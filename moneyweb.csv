1,2022-06-14,Coinbase to lay off 18% of workers as crypto winter worsens,https://www.moneyweb.co.za/moneyweb-crypto/coinbase-to-lay-off-18-of-workers-as-crypto-winter-worsens/," Coinbase Global announced Tuesday it will lay off 18% of its workforce in another sign of a worsening crypto downturn thats shaved off hundreds of millions of the total cryptocurrency market value. The USs biggest crypto exchange is following in the footsteps of other cryptocurrency-related businesses that have recently cut staff, including rival exchange Gemini Trust and lender BlockFi, both of which cited the arrival of a crypto winter  a prolonged downturn  as the reason for the layoffs. Read: Coinbase had hired aggressively in recent years, with its workforce ballooning by about 1,200 employees this year. The company plans to lay off roughly that amount, ending the current quarter with about 5,000 employees. Until recently, the company didnt acknowledge the arrival of a crypto winter, even though its shares have been dropping since it went public more than a year ago. They are down nearly 80% year to date, according to Bloomberg data. Laid off employees will receive a minimum of 3.5 months of severance, plus two weeks for every year of employment. The cryptocurrency downturn began soon after Bitcoin hit its all-time-high in November. Earlier this year, the collapse of the TerraUSD stablecoin and related Luna token erased billions of market gains. In the past week, coin prices plunged after crypto lender Celsius Network froze withdrawals amidst what many suspect was a bank-run-like event.  2022 Bloomberg",moneyweb,bitcoin,Neutral,"{'source': 'moneyweb', 'author': 'Olga Kharif, Bloomberg', 'category': 'Fast News', 'summary': 'The US’s biggest crypto exchange is following in the footsteps of other cryptocurrency-related businesses that have recently cut staff.'}","Olga Kharif, Bloomberg",Fast News,The US’s biggest crypto exchange is following in the footsteps of other cryptocurrency-related businesses that have recently cut staff.,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
2,2022-06-14,Bitcoin stems heavy losses but pessimism reigns in crypto markets,https://www.moneyweb.co.za/moneyweb-crypto/bitcoin/bitcoin-stems-heavy-losses-but-pessimism-reigns-in-crypto-markets/," Bitcoin steadied on Tuesday after earlier hitting a new 18-month low, as major crypto lender Celsius Networks freezing of withdrawals and the prospect of sharp U.S. interest rate rises shook the volatile asset class. Bitcoin clawed its way to positive territory after falling as much as 7.3% to $20,816, its lowest since Dec. 2020. It was last up 0.2% at $22,487. The worlds largest cryptocurrency fell 15% on Monday, its sharpest one-day drop since March 2020. It has shed about half its value this year and over 20% since Friday alone. Since its record high of $69,000 in November, it has slumped nearly 70%. Citing extreme market conditions, New Jersey-based Celsius said on Monday that it had frozen withdrawals and transfers between accounts to stabilise liquidity and operations while we take steps to preserve and protect assets. The move, combined with expectations of sharper U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate hikes after high U.S. inflation data last week, pushed the value of the crypto market under $1 trillion for the first time since January 2021. Most crypto players were pessimistic on bitcoins immediate prospects. With the broader risk sentiment firmly negative the sellers have had it all their own way for a few days, said Richard Usher at crypto firm BCB Group, adding that demand from medium term investors was returning. It will take a shift in the overall risk sentiment to turn the price around significantly. Bitcoins fall could also see wider consequences. U.S. software firm MicroStrategy Inc  a major backer of bitcoin  said last month a drop below $21,000 would trigger a demand for extra capital against a loan secured by some of its bitcoin holdings. That could see it stake more bitcoin against the loan or trigger the sale of some of its vast holdings. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside business hours. No. 2 token ether also recovered somewhat after losing as much as 10% to $1,075, a fresh 15-month low. Ether is down 75% from its record high of $4,869, hit in November.  Celsius, which has around $11.8 billion in assets, offers interest-bearing products to customers who deposit crypto at its platform. It then lends out coins to earn a return. The market is now panicking about the impact and contagion if Celsius becomes insolvent, wrote Singapore fund manager QCP Capital in a note. Crypto-linked stocks also tumbled, with MicroStrategy plummeting 25%, and crypto exchange Coinbase Global losing 11.4%. Crypto investors were already rattled by the collapse of the TerraUSD and luna tokens in May which were shortly followed by Tether, the worlds largest stablecoin, briefly breaking its 1:1 peg with the dollar. Higher U.S. inflation has not only roiled cryptocurrencies further but also other asset classes as investors dumped risky assets, with the S&P index falling for four days straight.",moneyweb,bitcoin,Negative,"{'source': 'moneyweb', 'author': 'Tom Wilson and Elizabeth Howcroft, Reuters', 'category': 'Bitcoin', 'summary': 'After falling 15% on Monday.'}","Tom Wilson and Elizabeth Howcroft, Reuters",Bitcoin,After falling 15% on Monday.,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1
3,2022-06-14,DeFi in turmoil as eye-popping yields prove too good to be true,https://www.moneyweb.co.za/moneyweb-crypto/defi-in-turmoil-as-eye-popping-yields-prove-too-good-to-be-true/," The notion that the cryptocurrency industry has near-magical powers to pay out yields that dwarf those found in the traditional financial world without much added risk is undergoing a rapid and painful reality check. Barely a month after the dramatic collapse of the Terra blockchain, whose Anchor protocol enticed investors with annual yields of almost 20%, crypto lender Celsius Networks halted withdrawals and some other transactions on its platform offering similarly eye-popping returns. Those active in the space insist that these are just growing pains for a young industry rather than glaring flaws that reveal profound existential issues, yet the episodes still have the power to shake up the ever-changing world of crypto finance. For all our crypto coverage click . What is happening with Celsius will have serious repercussions for the industry, said Mahin Gupta, founder of Liminal, a digital-asset custody platform. Its a not-insignificant player, and its apparent failure will have ripple effects. Read: .@CelsiusNetwork is pausing all withdrawals, Swap, and transfers between accounts. Acting in the interest of our community is our top priority. Our operations continue and we will continue to share information with the community.  Celsius (@CelsiusNetwork) June 13, 2022 Gupta and other professionals involved in crypto draw a sharp distinction between Celsius and the world of DeFi protocols. While Celsius is one of the big participants in the DeFi space, the company itself is more like a centralised bank or other financial middleman than a collection of DeFi smart contracts and algorithms governed by the democracy of token holders spread out throughout the world. Still, the episode that followed so closely on the heels of the Terra implosion highlights the inherent risk that  like the traditional banking system during the global financial crisis  various digital assets can be so tightly linked that a problem in one area can set off a greater unraveling, putting the whole construct under distress. Both Terras failure, which was triggered when that blockchains stablecoin lost its 1-to-1 peg to the U.S. dollar, and Celsius withdrawal freeze have exacerbated losses across a wide variety of cryptocurrencies. And both episodes have coincided with turmoil in traditional markets as the U.S. Federal Reserve embarks on a campaign to tame raging inflation by aggressively raising interest rates and reversing the easy-money policies it put in place during the Covid-19 pandemic. Investors should be keenly aware of how interconnected the different DeFi products are, as well as that they are all being impacted by Federal Reserve policy, said Hilary Allen, a law professor at American University who specializes in financial-stability regulation. There is no crypto safe haven. Observers are blaming much of Celsiuss issues on a token called Staked ETH, or stETH, which is an IOU fully backed by the Ether cryptocurrency. The token is issued in return for Ether that is staked, or locked up, until Ethereum completes its merge with an updated version of the blockchain and a follow-up upgrade. Staked ETH is 100% backed by Ether and while it has been trading at a discount to that token recently, that is no big deal in normal markets, according to Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer of Arca Capital Management. But this is not a normal market anymore  collateral values are shrinking, market liquidity is drying up, and lenders are struggling and pulling back, he wrote in a recent note. Thats caused the price of Staked ETH to deviate significantly from the token its meant to track. When that happens, trouble ensues since stETH is a token that can also be used as collateral for other loans. Said another way, a non-event suddenly becomes an event if cascading liquidations occur due to the temporary de-peg.  To Cam Harvey, a Duke University finance professor and author of a book on DeFi, Celsiuss woes are indicative of a failure of risk management on the companys part, not a sign of a crisis that threatens the broader space. Celsius didnt appreciate how illiquid that Staked ETH could be, Harvey said, ultimately leaving it in a poor position to meet demands for withdrawals akin to an old-fashioned bank run. To go into something thats relatively new that hasnt been around for a while and just assume that this is super liquid? That to me is a stretch, he said. I do think it will change behavior in terms of other companies, who will say Hey, we need to take scenarios like this into account. The Celsius episode is also likely to lead to a higher emphasis on counterparty due diligence and transparency when it comes to the flow of funds and performance of loans built into DeFi lending protocols, according to Sid Powell, CEO of Maple Finance, a lending marketplace for institutions. But dont expect the innovations of DeFi to disappear anytime soon, its proponents say, regardless of how widespread the pain is during the current bear market thats referred to as a crypto winter. Crypto and DeFi are stronger than any single participant, said Henry Elder, head of DeFi at digital-asset manager Wave Financial. Or, as Arcas Dorman puts it: This too shall pass, and it will again be a case study of whether or not we want to live in a fake world like TradFi where all problems are immediately fixed with Too Big to Fail bailouts, or if we want to live in a new regime where these relationships will eventually work themselves out  but many will suffer pain as it plays out.  2022 Bloomberg",moneyweb,ethereum,Positive,"{'source': 'moneyweb', 'author': 'Bloomberg News', 'category': 'Fast News', 'summary': 'As Celsius Networks halt withdrawals and some other transactions on its platform.'}",Bloomberg News,Fast News,As Celsius Networks halt withdrawals and some other transactions on its platform.,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
4,2022-06-14,Bitcoin slumps as much as 10% in deepening crypto sector selloff,https://www.moneyweb.co.za/moneyweb-crypto/bitcoin/bitcoin-slumps-as-much-as-10-in-deepening-crypto-sector-selloff/," Bitcoin extended declines on Tuesday as investor sentiment took another leg down over fears that bigger Federal Reserve interest-rate hikes loom to quell inflation. The worlds largest digital token shed as much as 10% to reach $20 824, the lowest level since December 2020. It then pared some of the drop to trade at $21 899 as of 11:20 a.m. in Singapore. A range of other tokens from Ether to Avalanche were also nursing losses. Sentiment for cryptos is terrible as the global crypto market cap has fallen below $1 trillion dollars, said Edward Moya, senior market analyst for the Americas at Oanda. He added a drop below the $20 000 level could lead to even uglier price action. Cryptocurrencies have become emblematic of a flight from speculative investments as monetary policy is tightened around the world to fight price pressures, draining liquidity from global markets. Crypto lender Celsius freezing withdrawals on Monday exacerbated worries about the stress in the digital-asset sector, which was already on tenterhooks after the collapse of the Terra/Luna ecosystem.  Traders are also monitoring MicroStrategy Inc, whose big bet on Bitcoin is backfiring. The firm loaded up on the coins and chief executive officer Michael Saylor became a flag-carrier for Bitcoin bulls with his nearly relentless optimism. Among the issues weighing on the company is the threat that an even deeper drop in the tokens price will require it to post additional collateral for loans. More than $1.1 billion was liquidated in the crypto markets on Monday  about $685 million of longs and $468 million on the short side, according to Coinglass data. Thats the most for both longs and shorts in at least the past three months, the data showed. Strategists were looking for signs of a crypto bottom. Mark Newton of Fundstrat Global Advisors said Bitcoin is getting closer to intermediate-term levels of support which suggest buying dips should be correct by the end of the second quarter.  2022 Bloomberg",moneyweb,bitcoin,Positive,"{'source': 'moneyweb', 'author': 'Joanna Ossinger, Bloomberg', 'category': 'Bitcoin', 'summary': 'A range of other tokens are also nursing losses.'}","Joanna Ossinger, Bloomberg",Bitcoin,A range of other tokens are also nursing losses.,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
5,2022-06-14,The world of crypto lending explained,https://www.moneyweb.co.za/moneyweb-crypto/the-world-of-crypto-lending-explained/," Major U.S. cryptocurrency lending company Celsius Network froze withdrawals and transfers on Monday, citing extreme market conditions, sparking a sell-off across crypto markets. Heres what you need to know about crypto lending  a corner of the digital asset market that has boomed over the last two years during soaring interest in cryptocurrencies.  Crypto lending is essentially banking  for the crypto world. Just as customers at traditional banks earn interest on their savings in dollars or pounds, crypto users that deposit their bitcoin or ether at crypto lenders also earn money, usually in cryptocurrency. While savings at traditional banks offer paltry returns due to historically low interest rates, crypto lenders offer much higher returns  at the very top end as much as 20%, though rates depend on the tokens being deposited. Crypto lenders make money by lending  also for a fee, typically between 5% to 10%  digital tokens to investors or crypto companies, who might use the tokens for speculation, hedging or as working capital. The lenders profit from the spread between the interest they pay on deposits and that charged on loans.  They are. Crypto lending has boomed over the past two years, along as decentralised finance, or DeFi, platforms. DeFi and crypto lending both tout a vision of financial services where lenders and borrowers bypass the traditional financial firms that act as gatekeepers for loans or other products. The sites say they are easier to access than banks, too, with prospective clients facing less paperwork when lending or borrowing crypto. The total value of crypto at DeFi sites soared to a record $110 billion in November, up fivefold from a year earlier and reflecting record highs for bitcoin, according to industry site DeFi Pulse. Traditional investors and venture capital firms, from Canadas second-biggest pension fund Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec to Bain Capital Ventures, have backed crypto lending platforms.  There are several. Unlike traditional regulated banks, crypto lenders arent overseen by financial regulators  so there are few rules on the capital they must hold, or transparency over their reserves. That means that customers who hold their crypto at the platforms could lose access to their funds  as happened with Celsius on Monday. Read: Crypto lenders also face other risks, from volatility in crypto markets than can hit the value of savings to tech failures and hacks.  New Jersey-based Celsius is among them, with over $11 billion assets in its platform. Other major lenders are also based in the United States. New York-based Genesis originated loans of $44.3 billion in the first quarter, with $14.6 billion in active loans as of March. Other big names include U.S. lender BlockFi, which has some $10 billion of assets under management, and London-based Nexo, which has $12 billion.  Crypto lenders are in the sights of U.S. securities watchdogs and state regulators, who say that interest-bearing products are unregistered securities. In February, BlockFi agreed to pay $100 million in a landmark settlement with the U.S. SEC and state authorities over its yield product. Those same state regulators issued a similar cease and desist order to Celsius in September, calling its Earn product an unregistered security. More widely, DeFi is throwing up risks for investors as it evolves to mirror traditional markets, a global body for securities regulators said in March, including a lack of disclosure of products and systems, patchy reliability and problems operating at scale.",moneyweb,bitcoin,Neutral,"{'source': 'moneyweb', 'author': 'Tom Wilson, Elizabeth Howcroft and Hannah Lang, Reuters', 'category': 'Fast News', 'summary': 'Customers who hold their crypto at these platforms risk losing access to their funds....'}","Tom Wilson, Elizabeth Howcroft and Hannah Lang, Reuters",Fast News,Customers who hold their crypto at these platforms risk losing access to their funds....,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
6,2022-06-13,Bitcoin drops to levels last seen in December 2020,https://www.moneyweb.co.za/moneyweb-radio/bitcoin-drops-to-levels-last-seen-in-december-2020/,"  A pretty brutal day for stock markets, but an even more brutal day for Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency crashed over 17%. In fact, it was 12% at the time of writing, but the day got worse for it. I suppose that even extends the losses that were wiped out from the crypto market to beyond $200billion. But lets get the take of Sean Sanders, the CEO of Revix. Sean, we need to stop meeting like this. Every time you come on the show, its bad news for your world. Yeah. I dont know what to say. It might be just our conversations. Good evening. How are you doing? Good evening. Im great. I dont think you are though. Tell us whats behind the latest  is it a crash, or is that overstated in the crypto market right now given the fact that, yes, we are seeing big losses across stock markets, but not to the quantum that Bitcoin and other cryptos are registering. Whats going on? Well, over the weekend you had news develop about Celsius. Celsius is essentially one of the top 10 crypto platforms globally. Its probably the second-largest lending platform within the crypto space, and theyve halted all of their withdrawals. So thatll send ripples throughout the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. It has been a brutal period. Whether or not that is whats been driving the decline may have been one of the factors, but youve seen Bitcoin down 15%-odd today, Ethereum down 17%. Im looking at the seven-day price chart, and Ethereums down 33%, Bitcoin 23%. So it has been a brutal, brutal period. Youve seen the market cap  and thats the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies  fall from a high of about $2.9trillion all the way down, now below the trillion-dollar mark of R980billion. So to say that this has been a sell-off would be an understatement. This has been a brutal, brutal period to be in crypto. What do you do, during this period?Well, if youve invested, youve got to sort of take a longer-term stance. You can either choose to sell out now, which is what a lot of people are doing. We have seen within the South African space, and certainly internationally as well, a lot of investors choosing to cash out their cryptocurrency, and turning that into fiat currency and moving that out of the crypto sphere. But this is sort of the opportunity. If youre looking out way into the future and you believe that crypto actually has a place in your portfolio and a place in society, this is where bargains are made. Right? Maybe. If we circle back to your the reference to Celsius, that crypto-lending company, [which has] around 1.7million customers who perhaps cant get their money right now  you say that theyre the top 10  what about the others? What could their halting of withdrawals, citing extreme market conditions, possibly mean for other crypto lenders? Are we expecting to see them follow the same course? Well, there has always been this air around Celsius, where theres been, I guess, strange dealings that have happened with the directors and some sort of senior management within that company. Theres a lot of other crypto lenders out there. Nexo is another provider, and Blockfire. These other entities have got slightly different licensing arrangements. Theyve been quite outspoken about Celsius over the years. Its always easy to say this in hindsight. I must say as well that Celsius isnt sort of down and out. Theyve halted withdrawals. Thats literally been announced this morning. They may very well come back. But what does it mean for the rest of the market? Certainly, when looking at crypto platforms and all the rest, there are a bunch of really top-class, top-quality platforms out there. They do treat their customer funds just like a bank. They follow the right processes and all the rest. But I suppose these lenders in this space, the likes of Celsius, do essentially take more risk than your normal crypto exchange or crypto-investment platform. I think whats happened here is Celsius seems to have been caught out. So just in terms of where to from here, I read a comment that in the previous bear markets Bitcoin had dropped around 80% from its last record high, and that currently it is down around 63% from its last all-time high, which was hit in November. This particular analyst said that we therefore could see much lower Bitcoin prices over the next month or two. Id like to know your view on that  do you agree or disagree? Well, I think if you look at the fear-and-greed index, which is used in all asset classes but really used within crypto given that sentiment is such a big driver of the market, youre sitting at the lowest levels that you can possibly get. At the moment 11 out of a 100 [is] extreme fear. So could we go lower? Yeah, we definitely, definitely could. If you saw the number of liquidations that happened within the crypto space just earlier today, they hit a new record as well. So there has been a lot of blood on the street, as they would say. And yeah, the crypto market could definitely, definitely drop lower. Is that my base case? I have said this on the show before: I actually dont know and I dont pretend to be able to guess whats going to happen in the crypto market over the next few months. I think when you look out over the much longer term, thats essentially why Ive chosen to build the business in this space, because thats what excites me. But I think over the short term sentiments definitely pointing negative. I dont see there being a higher probability of upside relative to downside. Its really, really negative at this stage.Sean, well leave it there for now. Thanks for the honesty, [for] not pretending to know it all. Its refreshing.

The worlds largest digital token tumbled as much as 17% to $22 603  its lowest since December2020. Other cryptocurrencies also declined as a broader sell-off continued. The MVIS CryptoCompareDigital Assets 100 Index, which measures 100 of the top tokens, dropped as much as 17%. And thetotal market value, which topped $3 trillion in November, dropped below $1 trillion as of 10:54 New York time on Monday, according to CoinGecko. The fundamentals to support stabilization and recovery just arent there, said Steven McClurg, co-founder and CIO at crypto fund manager Valkyrie Investments. Things can and likely will get worsebefore they get better.  The shares of companies that have embraced crypto also tumbled. MicroStrategy Inc, the softwarecompany that made buying Bitcoin part of its corporate strategy, fell as much as 28%. JackDorseys Block Inc dropped by as much as 10%. Bitcoin miners Marathon Digital Holdings Inc andRiot Blockchain Inc slumped as much as 19% and 16% respectively. Binance, the largest crypto trading platform,temporarily suspendedwithdrawals of the Bitcoin networkbecause of a transaction processing issue. Withdrawals were still being made on other networks. The selloff comes as traders are boosting bets for a more aggressive pace of Federal Reservetightening after data on Friday showed that US inflationjumped to a fresh 40-year high in May. Cryptocurrencies, which have struggled amid the Feds policy in recent months, have been hitparticularly hard. The collapse of the Terra/Luna ecosystem last month, and lender Celsiuspausingwithdrawals on Monday morning Asia time, have further eroded confidence in the space. If you do get long, perhaps think about doing so with either a long call spread or short put spread tolimit risk on Bitcoin futures, said Rick Bensignor, president of Bensignor Investment Strategies and aformer strategist at Morgan Stanley. If this dives, theres no reliable support nearby. Traders speculated that Celsius could face further risks if the broader market selloff deepens. A loanworth more than $278 million, one of the biggest single loans on decentralised lending platformMakerDAO, is labelled as a loan made by Celsius, according to data tracker Block Analitica. If Bitcoinfalls below $22 534.89, the position will be liquidated, adding more sell pressure for Bitcoin, theanalytics firm said. Data shows that the address used 17 919 wrapped Bitcoin, a version of Bitcoin that can be used indecentralised finance, as collateral for a loan worth $278 490 419 in the decentralised stablecoin DAI.While the blockchain explorer Etherscan didnt label the wallet as Celsius, awallet from Celsiussent an additional 2 000 wrapped Bitcoin to support the position.

8,2022-06-13,Crypto lender Celsius stops withdrawals,https://www.moneyweb.co.za/moneyweb-crypto/crypto-lender-celsius-stops-withdrawals/," Celsius Network paused withdrawals, swaps and transfers after weeks of speculation over the sustainability of the outsized returns being offered by the DeFi lending platform, fueling a broad cryptocurrency selloff. Crypto markets tumbled after the Celsius announcement, with Bitcoin dropping as much as 14% to the lowest level since December 2020 and other major tokens like Ether also falling sharply. Celsiuss CEL token was down about 50% to 19 cents as of 7:16 a.m. in New York Kong, according to pricing data site CoinGecko. The meltdown is the latest blow to DeFi, or decentralised finance, cryptos answer to traditional finance, with more control and less costs for users but also less oversight and more risk. Doubts about the sky-high yields backing products such as those Celsius offers haveafter the collapse of the Terra ecosystem in May, and as tighter monetary policy across the world curbs demand for riskier assets. The CEL token promises actual financial rewards, including as much as 30% extra returns weekly, according to its website. While the collapse of the TerraUSD (UST) stablecoin captured most of the markets attention, one of the projects main attractions for investors had been its promised interest rate, set as high as 20% for UST deposits in the Terra blockchain-based lending project Anchor. Celsius was an investor in the project. Both revolve around the promise of super-high yields to keep up demand, which itself depended on a steady flow of new entrants feeding the system, or borrowing to pay the high rates. Nexo, a London-based competitor, announced on Twitter that its ready to buy any remaining qualifying assets of Celsius, which it defined as mainly their collateralized loan portfolio. Nexo laterpublisheda letter of intent outlining the offer on Twitter. A Nexo spokeswoman confirmed the tweets. Nexo also said it had reached out to Celsius to offer support, but our help was refused. The firm has a strong liquidity and equity position, a spokeswoman said by email without giving details. Celsius didnt immediately respond to requests for comment on Nexos statement. A little over a day before announcing the halt, Celsius Chief Executive Officer Alex Mashinsky appeared to counter speculation about a freeze on withdrawals,tweetingMike do you even know one person who has a problem withdrawing from Celsius? in response to a post by Mike Dudas, a crypto investor and co-founder of The Block. In announcing the move, Celsius said: We are taking this action today to put Celsius in a better position to honor, over time, its withdrawal obligations. It added that users will continue to accrue rewards during the pause. . is pausing all withdrawals, Swap, and transfers between accounts. Acting in the interest of our community is our top priority. Our operations continue and we will continue to share information with the community. More here:  Celsius (@CelsiusNetwork)  The announcement landed in the midst of turmoil in crypto markets, with worse-than-expected US inflation data on Friday stoking expectations of faster interest rate increases, hitting riskier assets like digital tokens. Bitcoin has tumbled 47% this year, while Ether has lost about two-thirds of its value. Theres No Hiding From the Bad News This Time: John Authers The Celsius news added fuel to the fire, adding to the uncertainty in the market, said Vijay Ayyar, vice president of corporate development and international at crypto platform Luno. There is a lot of pressure on prices as we go into the week of Fed decision coupled with concerns on the protocols offering high-yield products. Tokens linked to lending and borrowing protocols underperformed on Monday, with their overall value down 10% compared with a 6.4% drop in the broader crypto universe, according to CoinGecko. Celsius peers Aave, Maple and Compound slumped 12%, 15% and 13%, respectively. Ethereum blockchain data shows that the largest single digital wallet holding CEL tokens is a wallet that belongs to Celsius itself, with more than 184 million CEL tokens, or 26.6% of the total supply in circulation. Mashinsky clarified in a weekend tweet that Celsius hadnt been selling the token. Ran, no need for a debate Dylan just did not know we have published our wallets for the past 5 years and anyone can see we were not selling CEL. see at the bottom of this page  Alex Mashinsky (@Mashinsky)  The collapse of the TerraUSD stablecoin and its sister token Luna in early May spawned widespread skepticism of the juicy returns crypto lenders like Celsius and decentralized-finance platforms have been promising investors. Anchor, a project linked to the Terra ecosystem, had offered yields of roughly 20% before TerraUSD, or UST, crashed.

The MVIS CryptoCompare Digital Assets 100 Index, which measures 100 of the top tokens, dropped as much as 9.7%. Cryptos remain at the mercy of the Fed and stuck in a merry dance with the Nasdaq and other risk assets, said Antoni Trenchev, co-founder and managing partner of crypto lender Nexo. Were hearing Bitcoin forecasts in the mid-teen and single-digit thousands which tells you the type of macro environment crypto is facing for the first time  and the levels of fear.  Traders are boosting bets for a more aggressive pace of Federal Reserve tightening after data Friday showed US inflation jumped to a fresh 40-year high in May. Cryptocurrencies, which have struggled amid the Feds policy in recent months, have been hit particularly hard. The collapse of the Terra/Luna ecosystem last month, and lender Celsius pausing withdrawals Monday morning Asia time, have further eroded confidence in the space. Typically, Id suggest being a buyer here on Bitcoin futures, said Rick Bensignor, president of Bensignor Investment Strategies and a former strategist at Morgan Stanley. But if you do get long, perhaps think about doing so with either a long call spread or short put spread to limit risk. If this dives, theres no reliable support nearby. Other coins were also having a difficult time, with Ether off as much as 12% to its lowest level since February 2021. Avalanche dropped as much as 15%, Solana up to 14% and Dogecoin as much as 11%. If Ethereum continues to bleed toward $1 200 (the 200-week moving average) the outlook for other altcoins becomes even bleaker, Trenchev said.  2022 Bloomberg",moneyweb,bitcoin,Neutral,"{'source': 'moneyweb', 'author': 'Joanna Ossinger and Suvashree Ghosh, Bloomberg', 'category': 'Bitcoin', 'summary': 'Other coins also having a difficult time.'}","Joanna Ossinger and Suvashree Ghosh, Bloomberg",Bitcoin,Other coins also having a difficult time.,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1
10,2022-06-13,Crypto criminals walk free because of lack of resources,https://www.moneyweb.co.za/moneyweb-crypto/crypto-criminals-walk-free-because-of-lack-of-resources/," Specialist police officers in the UK have reached out to financial fraud lawyers for help in obtaining justice for victims of small-scale crypto fraud. The Criminal Prosecution Service [CPS] in the UK has limited resources and will only prosecute cases which it thinks have a very strong chance of success, says Vanessa Whitman, a finance disputes lawyer who specialises in crypto at the international law firm CMS. Police in the UK have the skills to trace down bad actors in crypto crime, she tells Moneyweb, but the problem in obtaining convictions stems from a resourcing issue.  Many complaints being fielded in the UK are similar to those voiced by members of Mirror Trading International and Africrypt, two South African crypto schemes that lost investors billions of rands after promising outlandish returns. Law enforcements focus on big-ticket crypto scams leaves victims of smaller-scale crypto thefts  such as 1 000 (about R20 000)  without justice or compensation for their stolen funds. Such amounts dont make the same headlines that the  do, but these crimes are evidently far easier to get away with.  Victims are [feeling] an increasing sense of frustration, and so are the police, says Whitman. In an effort to obtain some degree of justice, victims will often turn to civil lawyers like Whitman for assistance. But the costs of civil prosecution often make any potential victory a pyrrhic one. Instructing civil lawyers to go and get court orders to serve on exchanges is very expensive, says Whitman, and if you are a victim who has lost a couple of thousand pounds or dollars worth of crypto, thats soon going to be eclipsed by the cost of any legal action.  An entire industry of blockchain analytics has grown around tracing cryptocurrency movements. And the same technology can be used to trace dirty crypto. Every transaction on a blockchain is logged and publicly accessible. The transaction shows how much was transferred, from which wallet address, and to which address. The enforcement folks have got really good at working out who people are, says Charles Kerrigan, a crypto and digital assets lawyer at CMS. So you can trace connected addresses. And you can see clues that indicate where the person might be located, or who their affiliates might be, or other projects that theyve been involved in, both positive and negative. Criminals leave a trail of breadcrumbs that inevitably lead to an exchange that requires identification to convert that crypto to fiat currency. And then law enforcement can pounce. One of the hard problems, if youre a criminal thats using crypto to launder funds, is that you may have a paper net worth of a vast amount, but its just inaccessible, Kerrigan tells Moneyweb. There was a very large hack a few years ago and those funds had sat there for four or five years. And it was just publicised that the hackers in New York have been found and arrested. Some of those coins had gone through mixers, and privacy coins, and been through 50 000 transactions. But not even 50 000 transactions put them beyond the reach of the software and surveillance that applies to it. Mixers are decentralised crypto services that mix multiple sources of crypto to obscure their source. And privacy coins are cryptocurrencies that attempt to obscure blockchain transactions so that privacy can be maintained.  The other factor thats needed to help victims of small-scale crypto crime is buy-in from exchanges, Whitman says. In one case she worked on, she attempted to obtain cooperation from the 20 largest exchanges to block a particular wallet address that she and her team had unequivocally linked to stolen crypto. The range of responses she received was an eye-opener. Whereas some exchanges were highly cooperative in the interests of preventing fraud within the industry, others ignored the request altogether or simply refused to cooperate in the absence of a court order. A few exchanges completely misunderstood the meaning of the message. The broad range of responses tells us that something must be done to standardise the approach of the exchanges, she says. Whitman adds that there is also a lot of goodwill in the crypto industry that comes from players really interested in wanting to see the crypto ecosystem succeed. This helps offset the Wild West reputation that crypto has acquired.  Retail investors sometimes dont have all the information, says Kerrigan. Many are relatively inexperienced investors, and that inexperience can end up costing them five or 10 grand. These smaller losses, when aggregated, add up to a tidy sum, but its because theyre made up of small amounts that they do not get the attention they deserve. Losing a few thousand rand is not like losing R5 million or R5 billion, but it does have an impact on crypto adoption. So you just cant have things like that happening, says Kerrigan. We need to have tools that are available at a large scale and a small scale. Theres every incentive to chase down the big ones. We also need to ensure that weve got the incentives and the tools to chase down the small ones. The other problem is that even if law enforcement suddenly had more resources to tackle every case, criminal law is more about punishing the criminal rather than compensating the victim. This can leave the victim short of their stolen funds, even if justice has been obtained for the crime itself. Whitman and Kerrigan are working with others in the crypto sector on a proposal that could revolutionise the way crypto crime is prosecuted in the UK and, if accepted, could be exported elsewhere in the world to countries like SA. The proposal seeks to implement quick access to justice for victims of crypto crime on a self-management basis, without the need for costly lawyers. The proposal is still at an early stage, and details are still a little sketchy, but Whitman is hopeful it will offer a much-needed solution for victims of crypto crime.",moneyweb,sol,Positive,"{'source': 'moneyweb', 'author': 'R Paulo Delgado', 'category': 'Moneyweb Crypto', 'summary': 'Small-scale crypto crime often goes unprosecuted and civil recourse is prohibitively expensive.'}",R Paulo Delgado,Moneyweb Crypto,Small-scale crypto crime often goes unprosecuted and civil recourse is prohibitively expensive.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1

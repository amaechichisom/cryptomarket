0,2022-06-16,Serum Review: Solanas One-Stop DeFi Toolbelt,https://www.coinbureau.com/review/serum-solana/," DeFi saw tremendous growth in 2021, with the total value locked (TVL) in DeFi products and protocols peaking at $250 billion in December 2021. While most of this TVL was concentrated in the Ethereum ecosystem, we have now begun to seeas projects and TVL are migrating to other chains such as BNB,,, etc. Among these chains, Solana is leading the charge in DeFi due to its low transaction costs and incredible speed. In particular, the Serum protocol has been a significant player in simplifying the process for DeFi projects to onboard and share liquidity in Solana. Serum has helped a number of projects such as,,, Jupiter, etc., build amazing DeFi products while leveraging Serums central limit order book and matching engine to enable frictionless trading. In this article, we take a closer look at the Serum protocol to find out who is behind it, what makes it promising and whether it will survive in the long run. Page Contents  []  is a permissionless base protocol layer for decentralized exchanges built on the Solana blockchain that allows developers to create their own DEX user interface on top of it. On the protocol level, Serum features a fully on-chain, non-custodial order book mechanism that allows users of DeFi projects leveraging Serum to place on-chain bid or ask orders with specific prices.  The central order book of Serum also allows DeFi projects using it to benefit from true composability and access to ecosystem-wide liquidity. Being built on Solana, Serum enables users to execute trades with low latency and incredible speed at affordable and cheap network fees. Serum also has its own tokens called SRM and MSRM that unlock trading fee discounts for holders based on the number of tokens held. According to, Serum currently occupies 3rd place in overall TVL within the Solana ecosystem, with over $222 million in assets locked on its platform. The Serum Project was built by the Serum Foundation, which is backed by several heavy-weights in the industry, such asand the teams at FTX, Alameda Research, and the Solana Foundation. Serum officially launched on 31st August 2020 and was one of the first major open-source projects to build on Solana.  Serum was built as a solution to the problems faced by DeFi users on Ethereum in the summer of 2020. Defi platforms were extremely limited in functionality at the time, and users had to pay high gas costs to transact on them. To solve this and provide a better experience for DeFi users, the Serum Foundation decided to build Serum on the Solana blockchain, which processes transactions at 65,000 transactions per second. The team also decided to provide users with an on-chain order book, unlike other DEXs that typically use a liquidity pool, to give them an experience similar to centralized exchanges. The Serum DEX took about three months to develop, with the whitepaper being released in July of 2020.  When it first launched, Serum featured its own basic trading interface that developers could fork and build upon to integrate with the Serum protocol. However, once enough projects had started to develop their Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) on Serum, the protocol removed the trading interface so that all trading activity comes via several GUIs built on top of it. While Serum does not host its own trading user interface anymore, its current model allows it to host one of the most vibrant and liquid Defi ecosystems. Developers and projects are incentivized to build on top of Serum to gain access to its massive liquidity via the central limit order book system. A few exchanges built on Serum The liquidity and ease of creation allow developers to focus more on creating an efficient suite of Defi products hosted on an attractive and easy-to-use GUI. This has led to Serum becoming one of the most popular protocols on Solana for Defi projects to build on. To put it simply, its success is due to four key features: Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like ,  and  employ an automated market maker (AMM) that utilizes a liquidity pool to swap assets instantly and determine a price based on the ratio of assets present in it. In contrast, centralized exchanges like , , or  use an order book mechanism to facilitate the trade of assets. AMM vs Order Books Order books allow users to set limit orders and stop-loss orders. These orders enable the user to specify the price at which the order must be executed. AMMs, on the other hand, do not allow the user to specify the price at which they want to buy/sell the asset. Instead, the user is shown a live price based on the ratio of assets in the pool, at which they can buy/sell the asset. If youre thinking, Order books sound pretty convenient. Why dont DEXs offer them? Heres why. Most DEXs are built on Ethereum, a network whose relatively long latency makes an on-chain matching engine inefficient. This means that on-chain order books are not practically possible. However, Serum can use an on-chain central limit order book mechanism because it is built on Solana. The Solana network produces blocks every 400600ms, thats more than 10x faster than Ethereums 14-second block time (on average). This makes Serums on-chain central order book and matching engine quite efficient. Serum allows developers and projects to build more efficient DEXs by allowing them to access a central limit order book and matching engine that shares liquidity with other projects and DEXs building on top of it. In addition, the Serum protocol works in the back-end allowing developers to focus on creating efficient and attractive GUIs and financial products. Thus far, 30 GUIs have been listed on the official. Each of these GUIs offers various decentralized finance products. For example,offers margin trading and perpetual futures,offers spot and limit order trading, andoffers swap price aggregation services. DeFi in the Ethereum ecosystem is fragmented, with liquidity in one protocol unable to be accessed by another. Serum solves this by allowing a diverse range of applications and participants to share middleware in one place. This makes Serums architecture more suited to modularity. As a result, serum-based programs will offer more flexibility while adhering to some basic design principles and composability. The Serum DAO handles the governance of the protocol. Serums SRM token acts as the governance token used to vote for or against proposals. The Serum DAO has awhere community members can discuss various issues and eventually create a governance proposal for key issues on the official. Serum DAO Users must hold a minimum ofto create a governance proposal. To vote on a governance proposal, users must connect their wallet to the official governance page and deposit all their tokens. Then, they can choose to vote in favour of or against a particular proposal. While the vote is in effect and the voting period is ongoing, the tokens will be temporarily locked up. After the proposal is closed, the tokens are returned and can be withdrawn from the governance page. Serum Core is an asset agnostic order book system built bythat is yet to be released. If youre wondering what an asset agnostic order book is, heres the ELI5 version. Basically, the Serum protocol, afully on-chainorder book protocol, executes trade on-chain by calling a smart contract and transferring the SLP tokens after the matching engine matches two orders together. This means that the matching engine requires the transfer of SLP tokens under the basic Serum protocol. This becomes a problem for projects that want to introduce products such as perpetual futures trading under Serum, as they would have to tokenize users positions to do so. However, tokenizing positions becomes tricky because it requires encoding information such as collateral, position size, entry price etc. To solve this, Serum Core was built. Serum Core allows the on-chain order book to store state information and match positions without tokenizing them. Under Serum Core, the order book itself is a matching engine. When a match occurs on Serum Core, the matching engine triggers the creation of a position owned by the taker and held with the maker. Serum Core also allows projects to create their own order book or work with other existing order books. Order book exchanges generally have two fees: a maker fee and a taker fee. A maker fee is charged to a user who makes an order or supplies liquidity to an order book. A taker fee is charged to a user who accepts an order or removes liquidity from an order book. The Serum protocol only charges users a fee for taker orders. This means that maker orders are not subject to a fee as they provide liquidity. Since Serums matching engine fulfils these orders, it charges taker orders a fee ranging between 3 basis points (bps) to 4 basis points (bps). The fee levied depends on the amount of SRM tokens you hold. The collected protocol fees are split into two- 80% of the fee goes towards the buyback and burn of SRM, and 20% of the fee goes towards the project or GUI hosting the activity. Serum Fees Discounts You can find the different fee discounts and the corresponding SRM holding in the picture above. Apart from these fees, the different GUIs building on top of Serum might also charge their own fee. The Solana network will also charge a minimal transaction fee, and in certain situations, it might also charge something known as an open order account rent fee. The open order account rent fee is 0.02 SOL per market pair. It is charged when trading a market pair for the first time and is used to create the intermediary open order account that interacts with the DEX. This fee can later be recovered if youre not planning to use that pair again. Serum is a decentralized protocol and does not follow any KYC or account verification process. Moreover, the different GUIs built on top of Serum might have their own KYC or AML process. But generally, most GUIs do not have any KYC or AML due to their decentralized nature. All you need to use the platform is aand some SOL tokens to pay for network fees. Serum has been privately audited. A public audit for the next version of Serum, called Serum V4 or Serum Core, is currently underway. Serum supports trading any SPL token as long as there is a market and liquidity for it. Moreover, the anticipated release of Serum Core will enable the trading of defi products such as Perpetual Futures without needing to tokenize them on the network. Serum does not host its own trading interface. Instead, it relies on the different DeFi projects building on top of it to do so. Many of these GUIs on top of Serum are very user-friendly and efficient. These GUIs provide users with a customized and unique trading experience, making Serums ecosystem quite diverse. You can find all sorts of defi products, such as a derivatives exchange, swap aggregator, crypto index, lending platform, etc., built on top of Serum. Primarily, Serum was designed to be a base protocol for the different Defi projects in the Solana ecosystem. It seems to have been able to stay true to this vision so far. Serum is a non-custodial protocol. It enables peer-to-peer trading between the different wallets in the Solana blockchain. As such, there are no deposit or withdrawal charges on Serum directly. However, remember that the different GUIs on top of Serum might have their own custodial features, such as collateralization account for derivatives or margin trading.  The Serum Project has two tokens in its ecosystem- SRM and MSRM. Both tokens exist as SPL tokens on the Solana blockchain. The SRM token is Serums utility and governance token. SRM token holders can vote on governance proposals in the Serum DAO and also avail of trading fee discounts based on the number of tokens they hold. MSRM token is a special token with a limited supply of 1000 MSRM. MSRM tokens are created by locking up 1,000,000 SRM tokens in a contract. They offer holders additional benefits and rights such as increased discounts and the ability to run a node. SRM has a maximum supply of 10,161,000,000 SRM tokens, and MSRM has a maximum supply of 1000 MSRM or 10% of SRM supply. Serum began with 10% of its token supply unlocked, with the other 90% slowly trickling into circulation in the form of validator and staking rewards over the next 6 years, beginning on the 11th of August 2021, at approximately 1/2190 per day. SRM Price History via The SRM token first began trading in August 2020. The token reached an all-time high of $13.72 in September of 2021 and an all-time low of $0.11 during its IEO in 2020. According to, the token is currently trading at $0.90 with a market cap of $236 million. The current price is due to a declining interest in Defi amid the current bear market conditions. SRM can currently be bought on both centralized and decentralized exchanges. The available markets are listed below Centralized Exchanges-,, Gate.io Decentralized Exchanges-and Serum DEX Yes, SRM can be staked to earn rewards and participate in governance. SRM can also be staked to run a validator node, earning you additional rewards. To run a validator node, you will need 10 million SRM tokens, with 1 million of them in the form of 1 MSRM token. Validators in the Serum project have two primary duties: to support cross-chain cryptocurrency swaps and . The second function refers to the fact that orders on the Serum DEX are not fulfilled automatically due to the nature of the Solana blockchain  they must be manually activated by a third party, in this case, a validator node. Serum is a decentralized project run by the Serum DAO. It has an active developer base with the Serum DAO granting funds to projects developing on Serum. While there may not be any customer support in the traditional sense, users can get their doubts or queries addressed in the projects Discord or Telegram channels. However, in my experience, the projects Discord channel is not as active or responsive as most other crypto discord servers. So you might have to wait a while or ask a question repeatedly before being able to secure an answer. Serum is an excellent protocol for DeFi projects and developers on the Solana ecosystem to build on due to the following reasons- Shared Liquidity All projects building on top of Serum share the liquidity and central order book. This makes the trading experience through consistent price feeds and larger trading volumes. Ecosystem The more projects built on top of Serum, the bigger its network and role in the Solana ecosystem. Permissionless Users of Serum can create market pairs on Serum without permission or authorization. It is a permissionless decentralized protocol that allows users and projects to leverage Serum in any way possible. Composability Projects built on Serum are truly composable with each other. With the upcoming release of Serum Core, the composability of projects on Serum will only get better. Serum is a great protocol with incredible promise for the Solana ecosystem. However, it can be challenging for beginners to learn or understand the project due to its not-so-optimized documentation practices. This is one area that Serum must definitely work on. While researching for this article, I found that the protocol has gone through many changes in the past two years, but the documentation of these changes was not so easy to find. Their official documentation can also do with more details on their security audit status or how the DAO governance works in better detail. Apart from the problems with documentation, Serum also seems to be suffering from a lack of support for newcomers in their official Discord channels. I noticed that researchers and beginners have left many questions unanswered by the moderators or team. This does not bode well when building a strong, engaging community. Serum is a truly promising project that has achieved many of its goals since its launch. It also has backing from some of the best minds and teams in crypto, such as Sam Bankman-Fried, FTX and Solana. The Serum Core is an anticipated upgrade to the current order book of Serum that will help bring to life many more projects on the Serum DEX.  The Serum Project was built by the Serum Foundation, which is backed by several heavy-weights in the industry, such asand the teams at FTX, Alameda Research, and the Solana Foundation. Serum officially launched on 31st August 2020 and was one of the first major open-source projects to build on Solana. The SRM and MSRM tokens are used to unlock discounts in trading fees, run a node and participate in governance proposals. The Serum Project is built by a solid team with backing from Solana, FTX and Alameda Research. The Serum protocol is open source and is awaiting the release of its public security audit report. SRM is the native token of the Serum Protocol, which ranks 3rd in TVL held across Solana. Currently, DeFi and its overall TVL are dwindling due to the bear market caused by macroeconomic factors. However, DeFi could see a significant uptick in user activity and interest by the time the next bull run rolls around, leading to a price increase for tokens whose protocols have survived during the bear market. Moreover, the Serum protocol powers a number of DeFi products on the Solana blockchain, leading to a wider use case than most other Defi tokens.

1,2022-06-11,Raydium Review: Solanas DeFi Liquidity Mammoth,https://www.coinbureau.com/review/raydium-solana/," Thehas been notorious forover the past three months. This has caused recent sentiment around Solana to turn sour, but there is no denying that it has one of the best teams backing and building on it. This is why I thinkmight still be around in the top 10 during the next bull run. One of the reasons Solana still deserves credit despite its outages is its incredible transaction throughput and what it can do for DeFi. Solanas DeFi ecosystem, in my blasphemous opinion, is in some ways superior to whatcurrently provides. And no, Im not talking about the low gas costs. Im referring to Solanas incredibleand its network of decentralised exchanges building on top of it. Serum allows DEXs built on top of it to leverage its central on-chain order book, leading to cross-exchange liquidity, which benefits users! But thats not all. There are a ton of applications building on top of Solana that deserve individual attention due to their innovative models. For example, last month, we took a look atand what it has done for on-chain derivatives trading. This time, were exploring another diamond from the Solana ecosystem that provides the best liquidity and spot trading features for the ecosystem- Raydium. Raydium utilises Serums on-chain central order book for trading, allowing users to access trading features similar to those found at centralised exchanges. At the same time, Raydium can access and supply liquidity from its pools to other DeFi protocols within the ecosystem. In this article, we take deep-dive into what Raydium is, who is behind it, and whether its the right exchange for you. If you have a question, weve probably answered it here. Read on! Page Contents  [] is an automated market-maker built on the Solana blockchain that allows its users to trade, swap and earn a yield on digital assets. Being built on Solana, Raydium enables users to execute trades at instant speed and near-zero network costs.  Like most decentralized exchanges, Raydium employs a liquidity pool system for users to swap assets. However, Raydium does this by leveraging thebuilt on Solana. The Serum DEX integration allows users to gain access to an ecosystem-wide central limit-order book system that provides unparalleled liquidity compared to other platforms. Raydium also has its own token, RAY, which provides holders various benefits such as a share in protocol earnings, and access to the platforms native launch pad AcceleRaytor. In the future, RAY is expected to also act as a governance token granting holders potential governance rights. According to, Raydium currently occupies 4th place in overall TVL within the Solana ecosystem, with over $317 million in assets locked on its platform. Raydiums development began in the summer of 2020 and was founded by pseudonymous developerand their team. At the time, DeFi was just starting to pick wind and AlphaRay, a seasoned trader tired of Ethereums high gas costs, was looking for a solution to fix this. So he reached out to the FTX team and told them about his vision. In turn, FTX introduced AlphaRay to two projects they had been closely involved with and worked on- the Solana blockchain and the Serum protocol. Image via AlphaRay, along with other team members, saw the potential of Serum DEX and began building Raydium, which launched in Feb 2021. Raydiums team has over two decades of experience in market making, arbitrage, and high-frequency trading in cryptocurrency and traditional markets. AlphaRay is in charge of Raydiums overall strategy, operations, product direction, and business development. He has a background in commodity algorithmic trading, but in 2017 he shifted to cryptocurrency market making and liquidity provision. Other notable team members include GammaRay and XRay. GammaRay is the marketing and communications director. He is in charge of product development and strategy. His crypto speciality before joining Raydium was discretionary marketing and technical analysis. XRay is the Chief of Technology and the leader of the Development team. He has around eight years of experience in crypto and regular markets trading and systems architecture. X is also the architect of Raydiums infrastructure and systems. Raydium primarily offers four key features to its users: Raydium Features via The trading experience on Raydium is similar to DEXs on Ethereum, but with two key differences- unparalleled liquidity and the ability to place limit orders on select tokens. Both these features are possible due to Raydiums integration with Serum DEX. If youve never heard ofbefore, Serum is a base protocol layer for decentralised exchanges that allows developers to build their own DEXs on top of it. This allows exchanges leveraging Serum to access and share liquidity through its on-chain central limit order book system. Raydium also offers users a choice between two different trading experiences within its platform- Limit-Order Book and Swaps via liquidity pools. Raydiums Limit Order Book interface provides users with an experience similar to centralised exchanges, where the user can watch the price chart of the desired token pair and the top buy or sell bids placed by users of the exchange. Raydium Limit Order via As the name suggests, it allows users to place limit orders on selected tokens featured on its trading interface. Limit orders allow users to specify the price at which they would like their trade to execute. This allows users to experience a relatively stress-free trading experience compared to most other DeFi exchanges. Currently, Raydium actively supports around 260+ market pairs on its user interface. However, users can access and add any new market pair not listed on the interface as long as it has an existing market on Serum.  To add an existing market pair on Serum to Raydium, users need to create a custom market on the interface by clicking the + symbol above the trading chart on the interface and adding the market id of the desired pair. Be careful, though; certain custom market pairs might be deprecated, do not trade on them. Raydium also has a swap interface that enables the swapping of assets in a liquidity pool by using a constant function market-maker to determine prices. This interface might be familiar to those using decentralized exchanges on the Ethereum ecosystem for a while. Raydium Swap Interface via However, unlike its Ethereum counterparts, Raydiums AMM interacts with Serums central limit order book, which means that pools have access to all order flow and liquidity on Serum, and vice versa. This allows Raydium to offer users the best price possible for their swaps. Raydium does this by analyzing and determining whether swapping within a liquidity pool or through the Serum order book will provide the best price for the user and executes accordingly. Users can execute trades for any SPL token (SPL or Solana Program Library is Solanas Token Standard) as long as it has an existing liquidity provider or. Users can farm rewards in the form of RAY tokens by providing liquidity to the Liquidity Pools on Raydium. In addition, the exchanges permissionless pool system allows anyone to create a liquidity pool for any SPL token pair on the platform. This eliminates any whitelisting process for liquidity pools on the platform. Raydium Farms via Liquidity providers on Raydium earn a share in the total transaction fees earned by the platform by staking their LP tokens in farms. Around 88% of the fees collected are re-routed to the liquidity pool and earmarked as rewards for liquidity providers. The remaining 12% rewards RAY tokens for the staking pool. Raydium allows holders of its native token RAY to earn additional RAY tokens by staking on the platform and earning interest. Currently, the RAY staking pool offers a 10.29% interest rate on staked RAY. AcceleRaytor is Raydiums native launchpad that helps projects raise capital and drive initial liquidity in a decentralized manner. It is a part of Raydiums efforts to spearhead and promote development in the Solana ecosystem. This is generally achieved through launching an initial token offering on the Raydium platform. The Raydium team curates and vets projects to determine if they are a good fit for the platforms vision before listing their tokens on the launchpad. Raydium Launchpad via Participation in token offerings on AcceleRaytor is decided by a lottery system. Eligible users must enter tickets into the lottery and win a chance to invest. The more tickets you have, the higher your chance of winning an allotment in the IDO. To gain access to tickets, users must generally stake at least 100 RAY tokens for a minimum period of 7 days before the snapshot date. The longer you stake, the more tickets you win. Raydium charges a 0.25% fee for both maker and taker orders when executing a swap in its liquidity pools. This 0.25% fee is split and distributed as follows- For orders fulfilled via the Serum DEX, the transaction fee is paid to Serum and is determined by the number of SRM tokens staked. Generally, Serum charges an average of 0.22%, which decreases based on the amount of SRM held. Apart from the fees charged by Raydium for the use of its platform, users must also be mindful of network fees. Solana transactions typically cost between 0.0001  0.001 SOL. Raydium is a decentralized exchange and does not follow any KYC or account verification process. All you need to use the platform is access to aand some SOL tokens to pay for network fees. Moreover, unlike most IDO Launchpads, Raydiums AcceleRaytor does not require any KYC to participate in its IDO launches. With regulation around the world increasing, it is unclear how much longer this would be possible. Though, enforcement of regulation on decentralized applications remains nearly impossible. Raydium received anin 2021 by Kudelski Security and has since undergone numerous changes. Therefore, while a full re-audit is currently underway, the team has received extensive reviews from members of theteam via a bug bounty agreement. Raydium Initial Audit via AcceleRaytor, DropZone and stable-curve AMM programs have not yet been audited. However, an additional full audit that will review all upgrades and more recent programs is planned for Q2 of 2022. Moreover, Raydiums AMM uses the constant function pricing curve k=x*y to determine price according to the ratio of tokens in a liquidity pool. This means that Raydium does not rely on an outside oracle at this time for pricing feeds, eliminating the risk of Oracle manipulation in flash-loan attacks. Similarly, Solanas low latency and high throughput reduce the risk of front-running transactions. Currently, Raydium supports over 20, including Solflare, Sollet, TokenPocket,,, and Bitkeep, to name a few. Raydium Supported Wallets On the matter of supported cryptocurrencies, there is no bottom in sight as Raydium supports the trade of all SPL tokens on its exchange, as long as a liquidity pool or Serum market exists for the desired token pair. Furthermore, Raydium also supports wrapped versions of other tokens from different blockchains, such as wrapped BTC or wrapped ETH. The Raydium Platform is easy to use and navigate from a design perspective due to its simple layout and clean UI. All the website features are functional, and the text is easy to read. The darker colour scheme is easier on the eyes in low-light surroundings. The platform is also compatible with mobile devices and can be accessed via the mobile browser. The team is currently working on a cleaner, more optimized version of the platform for mobile devices. My only gripe with the platform is its limit order book interface. Some text seems to be squished together in certain areas of the site. However, this does not seem to affect its functionality. Just a visual eyesore. Moreover, the team seems to be actively addressing and resolving issues with the platform at the earliest opportunity. Raydium is a non-custodial exchange. This means that users do not deposit assets onto the platform to execute trades; rather, the platform facilitates seamless peer-to-peer trading via smart contracts in on-chain order books or swapping of assets in liquidity pools.  The Raydium token (RAY) is an SPL token that runs on the Solana blockchain. The RAY token is intended to be a governance token for the protocol in the long run. Currently, it grants holders a claim on a portion of trading fees collected by the exchange. Each trade or swap on Raydium incurs a 0.25% fee, where 0.22% goes to LPs (liquidity providers), and 0.03% goes to a staking pool that rewards users staking their RAY tokens on the protocol. Also, users wishing to gain access to the AcceleRaytor launchpad must stake RAY for a certain duration. RAY has a max supply of 555 million tokens minted at launch. More than 60% of the token supply is split between Mining Reserve (34%) and the Ecosystem and Partnership fund (30%). These tokens will be used to develop the ecosystem and reward early community members who have staked RAY. The team has a 20% allotment of the token supply with a three-year vesting period. The remaining tokens are split between the liquidity for AMM at Launch (8%), the community pool (6%) and advisors (2%). The community pool and advisor tokens are subject to a vesting period of 1 and 3 years, respectively. Raydium Price History via According to, RAY seems to be currently trading at $0.80, its all-time-low, with a market cap of $91 million. The token reached an all-time high of $16.93 during the peak of Solanas rally from $30 to $200 in September 2021. The current price of RAY is likely a result of Solanas dwindling DeFi TVL caused by its recent serial outages and, of course, the current bear market. RAY can currently be bought on both centralized and decentralized exchanges. The available markets are listed below Centralized Exchanges-,, Gate.io Decentralized Exchanges- Raydium and Serum DEX Yes, RAY can be staked atto earn staking rewards. The current rate of interest is 10.29% APR.  Raydium has responsive customer support with multiple channels for customers to get their issues addressed. Users can contact the Raydium team and raise support tickets via , or Telegram. I personally found the discord channel to be more responsive with at least one moderator present in the group at all times. Raydium is an excellent platform for trading tokens on the Solana ecosystem due to the following reasons- In terms of improvement, the first thing to address would be an expansion of the current range of products. While liquidity might be shared due to being integrated with Serum, Solanas DeFi ecosystem is fragmented, with users hopping between different decentralized exchanges to gain access to different products, i.e. margin trading, derivatives trading, etc. Id like to see an exchange that offers many products similar to centralized exchanges. Of course, I understand the difference in the size of operational teams between the two might make this wishful thinking. But a man can hope. Trading Charts on As for more realistic areas of improvement, Raydiums trading chart feature on its limit order book interface is something that most traders appreciate. It allows users to mark and draw trading patterns. However, it remains limited to the trading pairs whitelisted by Raydium unless youre willing to manually add a custom market and spend some SOL on network fees in the process. In my opinion, Raydium could improve on this by increasing the number of trading pairs on the limit order interface or by launching a dedicated trading chart interface for all assets on Solana. Raydium is undoubtedly one of the top DeFi projects to launch on Solana providing incredible liquidity for users. Their launchpad is also a force to reckon with, having launched many quality products in the Solana ecosystem, such as,, etc. Raydium is an excellent choice if youre thinking about exploring DeFi on Solana for the first time. Its user interface resembles most DEXs on Ethereum while also showing users Solanas promise of low latency trading and on-chain order books. So far, Raydium has been transparent with its documentation and audits. Raydium is also currently in the process of a security audit with. While its development team remains anonymous, they have worked closely with Solana and FTX teams while developing Raydium. Raydium charges a 0.25% fee for both maker and taker orders when executing a swap in its own liquidity pools. For orders fulfilled via the Serum DEX, the transaction fee is paid to Serum and is determined by the number of SRM tokens staked. Generally, Serum charges an average of 0.22% which decreases based on the amount of SRM held. RAY is the native token of the Raydium exchange which ranks 4th in TVL held across Solana. Currently, DeFi and its overall TVL are dwindling due to the bear market caused by macroeconomic factors. DeFi could see a significant uptick in user activity and interest by the time the next bull run rolls around, leading to a price increase of tokens whose protocols have survived during the bear market. Raydium and FTX or Binance fill two separate needs of crypto investors. While FTX/Binance are centralized and regulated exchanges, Raydium is a decentralised protocol that is unregulated. FTX/Binance might be more suitable for relatively risk-averse investors who dont mind leaving their crypto on regulated exchanges. Raydium on the other hand might be more suitable for a more experienced and risk-hungry investor who cares about maintaining privacy.

2,2022-06-10,Crypto.com Exchange Review 2022: A World-Class Crypto Exchange,https://www.coinbureau.com/review/crypto-com-exchange/," Here at the Coin Bureau, we find ourselves writing and filming quite a bit of content about Crypto.com. After all, they are one of the largest crypto companies in the world, boasting a massively successful platform with over 50 million users, launched one of the most popular crypto debit cards, have a multitude of products, and developed its own blockchain network ecosystem that is growing at an insane pace. Because of that, there are always a lot of things changing and new products to be covered, which leads us to this Crypto.com Exchange review that brings you here today. With all that being said, a company spinning so many plates have understandably caused a bit of confusion with their multitude of different products, apps, and features, so out of respect for your time and to make sure you didnt stumble across the wrong article, this review is strictly for the Crytpo.com Exchange, not the Crypto.com platform app.is an exchange for crypto trading. The Crypto.com platform features the Crypto.com debit card, Crypto.com Earn, Supercharger, NFT marketplace, and Crypto.com Pay. If you are looking for information about the Crypto.com platform or the Crypto.com DeFi Wallet, that info can be found in our. Now, with that out of the way, lets get down to the nuts and bolts of what the world-class Crypto.com Exchange offers. Disclaimer: I use the Crypto.com platform and hold CRO token as part of my personal cryptocurrency investment strategy.

Crypto.com Platform: 7 fiat currency support Crypto.com started as a company called Monaco in 2016 before undergoing the brilliant rebrand to Crypto.com in 2018, a smart marketing move on their part after acquiring the domain name for $12 million. The Crypto.com platform became massively popular, exploding in user adoption thanks to the Crypto.com platform and the Crypto.com debit card, which helped fund the decision to expand even further and launch the Crypto.com exchange in 2019. If you are interested in the companys history, we go into more detail in the Crypto.com Platform Review linked above. In the interest of brevity, well skip all that here and stick with the exchange. Image via Crypto.com The Crypto.com Exchange is a popular crypto trading platform where customers can trade over 200 spot crypto pairs, over 100 pairs using 10x leverage, over 100 perpetual markets and 7 futures markets. It is a highly secure, regulated, and reputable crypto trading platform that is available via web browser and mobile application, open to users worldwide and US-friendly. Note that Crypto.com has two apps, one for the platform and one for the exchange. Downloads for both can be found on the. **Important** For any app associated with finance or crypto, always use the app download or redirect link directly from the company website and avoid searching in app stores. Scammers can put up false apps that are nearly indistinguishable from the originals, complete with fake reviews and download numbers which have caused millions in stolen customer funds. In addition to the exchange itself, which supports API integration for things like EAs/bots/algorithms, the platform also offers a way for customers to purchase tokens at a discount in something called The Syndicate. There is a Trading Arena, a VIP programme and something called Supercharger, which is like anlottery which we will cover in this review. If you are looking for Guys take on the Crypto.com Exchange, he happens to have a review of the exchange as well:  Great, now that we covered some of the background, lets get into the exchange features.  The Trading Arena is where traders can compete and win exclusive prizes. Trading competitions and a gamified style of Vegas-type trading competitions have become very popular and are common among exchanges like the Crypto.com Exchange,, and. Image via Crypto.com Looking at some of the past events, traders could put their skills to the test and win prizes like $65,000, $100,000 worth of SPS from theTrading Battle, win tickets to Bitcoin Miami, and more. There are also lucky draws and trading races to keep trading exciting and provide skilled traders with more value than simply winning trades. A Look at the Past Splinterlands Trading Battle. Image via Crypto.com For those traders with deep pockets, members of the VIP programme may be eligible to enjoy special perks and higher rewards. The VIP Programme will be covered in detail further on. Once traders have registered for a trading competition, they will want to keep an eye on the leaderboard to see how they are stacking up against the competition. Trading Competition Leaderboard. Image via Crypto.com These trading competitions are a great way to attract traders to the platform. They are generally popular among traders who enjoy a bit of competition and fun. This feature is fairly new for Crypto.com and will likely get better; they will have some catching up to do if they want to compete with KuCoin, who, in my opinion, has the best games, perks, and prizes for active day traders. Supercharger is a feature available in both the Crypto.com App and Exchange, and it is something quite unique that I really like. It is a simple, flexible, and secure rewards platform that allows users to stake tokens that can be withdrawn at any time. In return, they earn popular crypto tokens daily that get deposited directly into their account. A Look at Supercharger. Image via Crypto.com It sort of feels like playing an airdrop lottery that always wins. You simply stake some CRO, and you get drip-fed daily rewards during the rewards period for whatever the reward token is, which can range fromandto smaller cap coins and newer projects that you may not have even heard of before. Crypto.com will announce the event, letting you know what the reward token is. If the reward is a token a user wants, they can stake some CRO during the charging period, which can be withdrawn at any time. The reward amount is based on the amount of CRO staked by the user, then paid out daily over the reward period, which can be 10, 30, or 45 days. Here is a simple two-step infographic on how to participate; it couldnt be easier: Image via Crypto.com I also like that this can be done passively. Once you participate in one event, you can select your CRO stake to automatically roll over to the next event. One of the reasons I found this feature great is that it can help diversify your portfolio, and often the reward token is for something I either want to HODL anyway, like BTC or ETH (nothing like free tokens!), or you can get rewarded with small-cap projects before they really take off and enjoy some nice capital appreciation. If you want to get into the nitty-gritty on how rewards are calculated and all the details on Supercharger, check out Crypto.coms. The Syndicate is another unique feature on the Crypto.com Exchange. Users can purchase new coins and tokens listed on the exchange at a deep discount. No need to tell you how rewarding this could be. Imagine if Binance had offered something like this when a token like(CAKE) launched. I wouldnt have said no to a piece of that sweet cake goodness at half price as the token saw near-vertical price action. Normally, the way The Syndicate works is that Crypto.com offers half a million dollars worth of the token to users who can pick up the token for a 50% discount, basically giving average traders VC-style access to discounted tokens. Here is a look at some of the previous Syndicate events: Image via Crypto.com The Syndicate is a fundraising platform for some of the most promising crypto projects, which list their tokens on the Crypto.com Exchange. CRO holders who stake CRO in the exchange receive priority token allocations and get first dibs at picking up these tokens at a discount. Here is a look at the CRO staking allocation and trading volume requirements that were needed to participate in theevent: Image via Crypto.com In order to participate in The Syndicate listing events, users need to: Here is a look at a previous Syndicate event for Filecoin to give you an idea of how it looks: Image via Crypto.com Be sure to keep an eye on the listing event timeline to know when the staking period runs and so you know when you will receive your allocation at the designated distribution time. I dont know of any other exchanges that offer a feature similar to Crypto.coms Syndicate. It is a significant attractor to the Crypto.com Exchange for those who want to take advantage of buying crypto at discounted prices. For the caviar eating, red carpet walking crypto guys and gals, the Crypto.com Exchange has a VIP Programme for you! Image via Crypto.com There are 3 VIP tiers that traders can fall under depending on their 30-day trading volume. Each tier allows them to enjoy some exclusive trading incentives and perks: A Look at the VIP Tiers. Image via Crypto.com This VIP program is in place to entice large volume traders and whales to the platform. Interestingly, the VIP program is only available to retail clients; no institutions are allowed. VIP 3 provides the lowest fees Ive seen offered by most crypto exchanges. As if those rock-bottom Crypto.com Exchange fees arent enough to entice traders, the VIP programme also provides the following benefits: It must be nice to sit at the cool kids table with swollen crypto bags and receive all those additional perks. As for me, my version of ballin out during a bear market is when I get to buy fancy aged cheese instead of the stuff that comes in single plastic wrappersYou know, the ones that arent legally allowed to even be called cheese? Yeah, you know what Im talking about. Cheese? No Thanks, Give Me Some of Them Merica Slices. Image via Yeah, those ones. Not great for impressing the in-laws when you show up with a pack of these instead of the salad they asked you to bring. This is a great additional feature to the platform that I quite like as it makes using dollar-cost averaging strategies automated and effortless. In addition, the Crypto.com Exchange has a DCA Trading bot accessible directly from within the platform; no complicated APIs, coding experience, or shady bot download websites are needed. Image via Crypto.com The bot allows platform users to sell or build their positions by placing orders automatically based on pre-set parameters. This means that you dont need to constantly watch the charts to jump in at the right time, leaving more time to hang out at the local milkshake establishment, enjoying some cold ones with your friends. The DCA bot allows users to automatically buy and/or sell crypto regularly over a pre-set time frame. It is useful for investors or traders who want to reduce the influence of volatility and average their way into or out of positions. DCA Bot Settings. Image via Crypto.com Once users set up the bot, they can name it and save the template to deploy the bot with the desired settings at the click of a button at a later date. Of course, the bot can be paused, ended, and its settings edited. The best part is this bot works for free. There are no additional fees to use it. If you are interested in automated trading and trading bots, check out our article where we dive into, and see if they are right for you. Customers can perform two staking functions on the exchange: CRO staking to unlock certain benefits or Soft Staking. Crypto.com Soft Staking offers users a new way to earn rewards up to 4% in interest annually on crypto held on the exchange, such as BTC, LTC, ETH and more. Rewards are offered on a flexible term with no lock-up period required. The max limit is dependent on how many CRO users have staked. Not bad, earning 4% on crypto just sitting there. Staking CRO on the Crypto.com Exchange provides users with a multitude of benefits such as: Here are the CRO staking benefit levels: Image via Crypto.com There is an impressive list of Crypto.com exchange-supported currencies and markets for traders to choose from. Regarding rankings, the top exchanges, Binance, KuCoin and FTX, offer more trading pairs and markets, with Crypto.com being in the middle as they offer more thanor. Crypto.com Exchange has come a long way over the past year and is only getting better all the time, now supporting: With these numbers, most traders will likely find something they fancy trading. The Crypto.com Exchange supports the following order types: As Crypto.com is one of the most heavily licensed and regulated crypto platforms around, I could not find a designated list of countries that are not supported. Reading the T&Cs, it looks like it is basically supported pretty much everywhere. Image via Crypto.com Aside from sanctioned countries, what I can make of this is that Crypto.com is available to be used in any country that doesnt outlaw crypto trading, which is pretty good. Ah, fees are always a fun topic. Crypto.com Exchange fees come in at a standard 0.4% Maker fee and 0.4% Taker fee for Tier level 1 without the CRO stake discount, placing the Crypto.com Exchange cheaper than Coinbase but slightly higher than FTX, Kraken, and Binance. Here is the fee table for Spot and Margin trading: Image via Crypto.com Here is the fee table for Derivatives trading: Image via Crypto.com There are two ways that users can lower these fees. The first is by doing A LOT of trading. Naturally, the Crypto.com exchange wants to entice whales and those who intend to trade high volume, so the more you trade, the cheaper the fees. If you trade over two hundred million dollars worth in a 30-day period, you can cut those fees down to 0.04% for Makers and 0.1% for Takers. The other way to save on fees is to stake CRO. CRO staking provides the following discounts: Fiat, other than USD, is not yet supported on the Crypto.com Exchange, and theyjustannounced USD support through bank transfer via SWIFT, with more fiat support likely coming soon. Image via Crypto.com Users who are not able to transfer USD via SWIFT have two options for funding their exchange accounts: Note that withdrawals from the Crypto.com exchange to your Crypto.com wallet addresswillincur a fee unless you use the Withdraw to App Function, which segues us into this pro tip to save you money: Pro Tip: Use thefunction to avoid crypto network fees when moving money between the Crypto.com exchange and Crypto.com platform. Withdrawing crypto from the exchange to external addresses will incur network fees which are highly variable and dependent on the network and token. Refer to thefor information about crypto withdrawal fees. After experiencing a pretty nastyin early 2022, Crypto.com has upped its security and now boasts some of the industrys highest security standards and accolades. It is good to see that all users who lost funds were fully reimbursed by the Crypto.com team. They have since significantly boosted their security measures and standards. Image via Crypto.com The platform drives a Zero Trust and Defence in Depth security strategy across all its systems and platforms. Data privacy assessments are built into the processes that protect and encrypt user information. Here is a look at some of the security features deployed by the Crypto.com team: Image via Crypto.com I like that 100% of customer funds are held offline in cold storage, meaning that corporate funds are used for daily customer transactions and exposed to risk. For USA-based users, fiat deposits are held in regulated bank accounts insured for up to $250,000. Crypto.com was the first crypto company in the world to achieve all of the following security milestones, certificates and compliances: From a customer perspective, the following security features can be utilized: The unfortunate hack aside, Crypto.com is one of the most heavily secured platforms, meaning that users should be able to sleep sound at night knowing their funds are as safe as they can be on a centralized platform. One thing I like to see is that the original founders of Crypto.com are still on the executive team, meaning they are dedicated to the company, the platform, and the vision. I often feel that too much shuffling of upper management is often a sign of troubles brewing. After all, if things are going well, why hire and fire? To me, a change of upper management can be akin to a losing sports team firing the coach. Crypto.com was founded by the following members: The team is made up of industry professionals with proven track records of success, and all executive and senior management have enjoyed successful previous ventures and high-ranking positions before founding and working for Crypto.com. Here is a bit about the executive team taken from the: Image via Crypto.com Whitepaper As the company expanded and is now a global enterprise, adding new team members was necessary. The Whitepaper highlights the other members of the senior management team, and I must say there is quite an impressive roster of heavy hitters. There is a lot of information about the specific team members that you can check out if you like; I will list the highlights that stood out to me: The list seriously goes on for ages. There are 10 pages in the Whitepaper highlighting the teams experience and accolades; they have some awe-inspiring talent on the team. The thing that stands out to me is how many higher management members they sniped from Google, Binance, Coinbase, PayPal and Visa, must be a heck of a place to work, and with an all-star roster like that, watch out! The early days of support werent great, to be honest, but after the profitable 2021 bull run that allowed Crypto.com to expand and market like crazy, it is good to see they also invested in scaling and training their support team as it is now fantastic and I cant find fault with it at all. I have personally reached out to the Crypto.com team for my account dozens of times, and I have always received a response typically between 10 minutes to 3 hours. I recently had a bit of a complex and unique case that required the collaboration of multiple different support members that lasted over 4 or 5 days. A team member stayed on the chat with me the entire time, providing progress updates, and they had to be flexible to accommodate the request and worked hard to resolve the issue before a looming deadline, providing me with absolutely stellar support and resolution, so a big kudos to them. A Look at the in-app Chat Support The team can be reached via live chat from within the app or online platform, as well as the email. The team is also very active and responsive on, and they have a well-built-outthat should be able to help resolve most questions and queries. Opening an account on Crypto.com Exchange is pretty straightforward; nothing too crazy here. An account can be opened in about ten minutes should everything go okay with ID verification. You can sign up to the account without submitting any KYC documentation if you just want to poke around and have a look at the platform, but if you want to deposit, trade, or withdraw, you will need to provide the following information: This will get you to the starter level tier, which will most likely be enough for the average trader as it allows for a $5,000 withdrawal per day. If you need to withdraw more than 5k in each 24-hour period, you will need to pass further account verification. Users who need to withdraw more than 5k, up to the equivalent to 100 BTC per day, will also need to provide: Note that for standard use of the Crypto.com Platform, the ID submission and selfie are a standard requirement, so if you use the Crypto.com app, then open up an exchange account, you will already have the higher level of KYC requirements needed. The trading interface on the Crypto.com Exchange is clean, intuitive, and easy to use, as you would expect from a world-leading crypto exchange. I might even take it a step further and say the effort they put into the UX/UI of the exchange makes them one of the more pleasant exchanges to use. Image via Crypto.com I took a look at some of the reviews online and could not find much in the way of negative criticisms against the exchange when it comes to issues like slippage, orders not being fulfilled, or dirty deeds like Crypto.com being suspected of wash trading, front running traders, or restricting withdrawals, it seems most traders have a pretty positive experience which is a plus. It really is a professional-grade, reputable world-class exchange and the order fulfilment is rated very highly thanks to the full revamped upgrades to the matching engine and order management systems undertaken in 2020, which led to a 10x increase in platform performance. Here is a look at the additional improvements implemented during that time: Image via Crypto.com When looking at the interface, plenty of technical analysis tools are available as the charting space is powered by TradingView. In addition, I like that the open orders, order history, tools, and the order book are all on the same screen, preventing the need to swap between different screens for different purposes.  I also like that you can swap between spot, margin, and derivatives trading without changing screens or platforms. It is quite a simple and functional platform for trading. I would rate it among the top trading platform interfaces alongside FTX and Binance. While the preferred trading method is using the Crypto.com exchange via web browser for the bigger screen and additional functionality, the Crypto.com exchange also has a mobile app for trading on the go. Remember that Crypto.com has two different apps, one for the Crypto.com platform and one for the exchange. Image via Crypto.com As far as trading apps go, the Crypto.com Exchange is well designed, functional, and very well laid out, making it easy to use and navigate. Though it is important to note that the app has limited functionality vs the web platform. These are the functions that can be performed on the app: I have used quite a few trading platforms and mobile trading apps in my day. I dont generally recommend them as a primary trading tool. Any professional trader will likely tell you that trading is not a joke. It is a serious job that isnt to be done from a mobile phone while standing in line at a Starbucks or stopped at a red light. Most serious traders have multiple screens and tabs open for multiple data sources. Their TA set-up is marked out well beforehand, and much of their time is spent switching between different tabs on different screens, something not easy to do on a mobile device. Most Professional Trading Setups Look Something Like This. Image via Shutterstock The only time I would personally use mobile trading apps is to monitor open positions while out and place or close the odd trade, but never as a primary trading tool. Though as far as trading apps go, the Crypto.com exchange app is very good, the team designed it to make it as functional as any trading app Ive used and better than many out there. If you would like to learn more about technical analysis, we have an article about, and if you prefer video format, Guy also has a great 3 part series on performing TA:  Yes, Crypto.com follows industry best practices when it comes to security and regulation. They are highly respected in the industry, used and trusted by millions of users worldwide. They hold some of the highest licenses available in the crypto industry and exceed many industry standards. In my opinion, yes. This is simply due to the fact that the Crypto.com Exchange has more trading option and lower fees, but both are great platforms. I would say Coinbase is better for beginners. No. FTX has seen the fastest growth and adoption of any crypto trading exchange, taking the number two spot in trading volume. They achieved this by being an incredible, top rated exchange that is functional and filled with features. Check out our  to learn more. Though for features not trading related to trading like earn, crypto cards, NFT marketplaces, etc. the Crypto.com platform outshines what is offered by FTX in my humble opinion. As Crypto.com is committed to the future of blockchain, they have taken ambitious steps in creating an entire crypto framework and are contributing massively to the entire industry, leaving many investors bullish on the project. Crypto.com is aiming to create a more efficient crypto ecosystem to rival the likes of Binance and Ethereum. Users who feel that advancing the crypto industry in this way are bullish on projects that undertake this feat, and many investors feel that Crypto.com is standing on a strong foundation and likely to see continued growth. Yes, Crypto.com is dedicated to bringing the next billion people into crypto and understands that user-friendliness is paramount. Ease of use is built into everything they launch. One of the issues that institutions and traders with large accounts may have with the Crypto.com Exchange is that trading liquidity and volume is pretty low compared to the top exchanges. This could negatively impact traders who place large orders, resulting in order filling being slow, or experiencing slippage. Image via Coin Market Cap To be honest, I havent actually heard of this being an issue at Crypto.com, I just know that these are issues that can be caused by low volume and have seen that this is a concern that has prevented some firms from opening up institutional accounts at Crypto.com. The good news is that volume is increasing as more users start using the exchange, and since the platform launched its Market Maker Programme attracting liquidity providers, this is becoming less of a concern. Crypto.com Exchange Market Maker Program Attracts Liquidity Providers. Image via Crypto.com This shouldnt deter the average retail trader though, as there is still plenty of volume for the likes of us. There are quite a few negative criticisms online about the exchanges lack of trading pairs and features, allow me to address those. When the Exchange was first launched, it was pretty bare-bones, with few pairs and few features available. It almost seemed like they released an unfinished product. Most of the negative reviews are from last year, and I must tip my hat to the Crypto.com team as this platform has advanced tenfold in just one short year, so many of the year-old criticisms are no longer relevant.  For me, in full transparency, the Crypto.com Exchange is not my favourite place to trade. Though they are adding more functionality and features all the time, so in time it could be amazing, and I will be keeping an eye on it. Binance and FTX offer a more robust platform for serious traders, with more tradable markets, more features, and lower fees, making those the more popular exchanges for serious traders. I would not be surprised to see the Crypto.com Exchange see high rates of adoption and an explosion in popularity similar to what FTX has experienced in the past year in the upcoming bull run though, so definitely worth keeping an eye on it. For now, I keep an account at the Crypto.com Exchange to take advantage of The Syndicate and Supercharger, and I use the Crypto.com Platform almost daily for the reasons outlined in the , but as far as trading goes, Ill be sticking to Binance and FTX for now.

The report provides an industry overview of the prevailing trends over the past few months, providing data on optimizing portfolio allocation and portfolio strategies based on market conditions. The report concludes that adding exposure to the top five crypto assets based on market cap can significantly improve risk-adjusted returns. They also found that including just 5% large-cap crypto allocation to a portfolio provides a better risk-reward trade-off than a Bitcoin-only portfolio when measured by the Sharpe ratio. One of the most consequential findings was that when comparing all return and risk measures across different rebalancing frequencies, they found that rebalancing quarterly provided the best trade-off for investors.

Algorand () is one of the most advanced layer-one networks in the blockchain industry, focused on sustainably expanding blockchain utility. Algorand was founded by MIT professor and Turing Award winner Silvio Micali and is one of the only networks to achieve carbon-negative status in 2021. Partnering with , a firm that specializes in  & digital product development, the duo announced a first-of-its-kind automated platform that will enable Terra users to seamlessly transfer their projects to the Algorand network. Image via Shutterstock The Algorand Foundation also announced that they will be committing 1 million ALGO to help Terra users make the transition. Were all working for the same dream of an inclusive, decentralized, and borderless global economy.

Utilizing the Algorand Migration Service, Terra developers will be able to migrate their NFT projects to the Algorand network while receiving support from the Algorand team. This move will enable Terras NFT communities to receive their newly migrated NFTs at zero cost, with the Algorand Foundation covering the fees.

7,2022-06-01,Digital Land: Investing in The Metaverse,https://www.coinbureau.com/education/digital-land-investing-metaverse/," As crypto investors, we are often seen as being a few fries short of a Happy Meal from traditional investors and no coiners. We do sit at the brunt of a lot of criticism and scepticism in the investment space, didnt you hear the news? Warren Buffett not only thinks Bitcoin is rat poison, but Remember that Mr. Buffett also passed on Amazon and Microsoft stocks in the early days. The Oracle from Omaha has been wrong about a few things, so I dont let that bother me. Mr. Buffett talks about Bitcoin the way a heartbroken high school kid slanders their ex on social media after a bad breakup. Warren, what did that mean old Bitcoin do to you? Maybe they are right, maybe our elevator doesnt go to the top floor, and perhaps we are the investor equivalent of that guy who tries to eat soup with a fork. Just when they thought we couldnt go any madder as we buy magic rainbow internet money that has no purpose or value, weve raised the crazy bar and are now buying magic imaginary real estate in virtual fairy tale lands. Gif via Tenor If we are crazy, talk about doubling down on our commitment and confidence in digital property. What we are going to explore in this article is digital land and metaverse investing and go over why this concept may not be as crazy as it sounds. Disclaimer: I invest in many of the projects mentioned in this article as part of my personal investment strategy. Nothing in this article is investment advice, metaverse investing is incredibly speculative and high risk. This article is for educational purposes only, do not make investment decisions based on the information presented here.  Page Contents  [] This is a doozy of a question; with no one size fits all answer. Asking what the metaverse is, is akin to asking someone what the internet is. You could ask 100 different people and receive 100 different answers. The one important thing to note is that the metaverse is not just one place, it is a global collaboration, just as the very internet is. If you think about what the internet is, it isnt Google, Facebook, or Amazon, it isnt any single entity like that, it is a global space of information accessible to anyone and contributed to by everyone. The metaverse is evolving to essentially work in a similar fashion and there are already multiple metaverses being built out. Facebook (yeah yeah, now Meta, I know) is building their own metaverse, Sony, Microsoft and Disney are building their own metaverses, and metaverses such as  and  already exist and have a user base. There are literally dozens of metaverses already underway, so it isnt going to be just one place. Image via My personal feeling is that the metaverse is going to be the next evolution or iteration of the internet we already use, a web 3.0 version of the current web 2.0 that the internet is today. The metaverse will work hand in hand, symbiotically alongside web 2. Eventually, the terms metaverse and internet may even be used interchangeably and used synonymously. Much like today, we simply use the term website, a term that hasnt changed for decades even though the underlying technology migrated from pre-HTML, through to HTML 1, HTML 2 all the way to HTML 5, users seldom care as we still just refer to them as websites. The key difference is that instead of accessing the internet with computers and smartphones, we will be fully immersed in these virtual worlds through virtual reality technology. A very simple dumbed down explanation by  sums it up beautifully, stating: I believe that just as you navigate to websites today for different companies and purposes, eventually, we will be navigating to different metaverses instead of websites. Some metaverses will be owned by companies while others will be community-owned and decentralized. These decentralized, community-owned metaverses will be places where companies and users can exist and set up shop as equals, as we have already seen with the likes of  who built the first digital bank in the Decentraland metaverse, and accounting giant Pricewaterhouse Cooper purchased land in the Sandbox metaverse. The Metaverse Will Likely be a Fully Immersive Way to Interact with the Internet. Image via Shutterstock This movement has just started and we are already seeing insurance companies, banks, video game companies, news agencies, advertisement companies and more who are all building within these virtual worlds. To get a firm grasp on what the metaverse and web 3.0 are, as these are massive topics to be explored on their own, we happen to have detailed articles that you should definitely check out. We have a deep dive explaining  and an article on If you are interested in going further down the metaverse rabbit hole, Guy also has a dedicated video on the top virtual land NFT projects: If you believe that the metaverse is the next evolution of the internet, as many do, then it is clear why there is limitless potential. If you asked someone in the early 90s how the internet may impact and shape the future, I doubt anyone would have been able to predict or fathom just how revolutionary the internet would become. The metaverse is likely to eventually encapsulate every company website, and everything we use the internet for today will take place in the metaverse. Gaming, shopping, working, tv and film watching, banking, and countless other things will likely become primarily conducted virtually. If you recall from my article on , an estimated 1/3 of the planets population are considered gamers, a figure that is growing and attracting more people to gaming metaverses. Just as most of us were not aware of our website browsing making the switch from HTML 4 to HTML 5, the 4.95 billion people on the planet who use the internet today, whether they know it or not, will be riding the internet train right into web 3, and potentially, the metaverse. Remember that internet adoption did not happen all at once, it was a trickle of users, that turned into a stream, that turned into a tidal wave, it is probable that metaverse adoption will follow a similar trajectory. Image via If you could go back and own a piece of the internet in the 90s, wouldnt you want to? Many see metaverse investing as a way to actually own a piece of the future infrastructure that will make up a huge part of our daily lives. The opinion that we will be spending the majority of our time in a metaverse is echoed by many such as Microsoft and Facebooks Meta. Metas View of the Metaverse. Image via While a totalitarian metaverse run by Zuckerberg as judge, jury, and executioner, scares the bejesus out of many of us, their  that shows all of us just chilling out and socializing in the metaverse, chatting, playing games, working, and more, I feel is a pretty good portrayal of a metaverse, but how about we use one not controlled by data-hungry, fear-mongering tech giants. Heck, even Mcdonalds, Chipotle and Wendys have launched virtual restaurants in the metaverse, so yeah, its a thing. Gonna Need a Virtual Diet Plan to Work Off These Virtual Calories Image via The metaverse will be accessible by anyone with a simple internet connection. This opens up companies to a potential global customer and client base without the logistical headaches and overhead costs of needing to physically expand your business into other countries. Collaboration will be able to thrive and exist at levels never before possible, creating limitless innovation, the likes of which we cannot even imagine today. Imagine the things that will be possible in a virtual world not restricted by the physical limitations imposed on us in real life. Lets take a look at some fast facts: It is pretty clear as to why there has been billions of dollars flowing into metaverse investment and development as this is likely going to be the place we all hang out in the near future. Think every hour we spend staring at screens now will likely translate directly to time spent in the metaverse. But what is digital real estate specifically, and what makes it so attractive? Metaverse real estate is parcels of land or property that exist in virtual worlds. In their most simple sense, they are pixels of land that make up a broader landscape that can be purchased and owned by connecting a cryptocurrency wallet, and accessed through a device with internet connection. Digital land is more than just digital images as they are programmable. Users can design them how they want and spend time there. Think of it like Minecraft but the key difference being that you actually own your items, can transfer them out of the world, and sell them for real-world monetary value. A Look at the Land Parcels Owned by Users in the Sandbox Metaverse. Image via Sandbox A common misconception about virtual real estate is that you need technical skills to participate which isnt the case for most metaverses. Popular metaverses like Decentraland have an intuitive drag and drop interface where users can create whatever they like with no coding skills required. With the rise of the metaverse, which attracts investor, company, and retail interest, the digital real estate industry is expected to grow. The virtual real estate market experienced a boom in 2021 after Facebook changed its name to Meta and announced its focus on creating a metaverse. As popularity in metaverses grows, virtual real estate is forecasted to have a . You might be asking yourself why anyone would want to invest in digital land, as it does seem a strange concept. After all, you cant build physical property on it, you cant physically live on it, and you might even be thinking it isnt even scarce. The planet earth only has a finite amount of land, which is what makes land valuable in attractive areas. A common criticism against virtual land is that we can create endless virtual worlds with limitless virtual land. We could create so much virtual land that everyone on the planet could have free access to as much land as they want, reducing any value in digital real estate at all. Anyone with any basic economic understanding realizes right away why investing in something with a limitless supply isnt always the best idea. This is one of Bitcoins strongest narratives over fiat currency as there is nothing stopping the Fed from creating new money out of thin air as we have seen in record numbers since the pandemic. Bitcoins finite supply is one of the reasons many people believe that there should be a Bitcoin standard and why Image via The ability to create an endless supply of digital land is a very valid concern, and one of the things that make metaverse investing so risky. A good metaverse investment comes down to the popularity/adoption of a metaverse and something known as network effect. We see how impactful and important network effect is on social media sites with Facebook being a great example. Everyone you talk to seems to hate Facebook and emperor Zuckerberg, yet everyone still uses it. Why? Simple, because everyone else is already there. If all your friends, family and favourite brands are on Facebook, as much as you may hate it, what is the alternative choice? You could go and start up your own, or find an alternative social media site, but if nobody else follows you, its no fun and pretty lonely being the only person using a different social media site. When None of your Friends use MySpace Anymore. Gif via VSGIF.com Metaverse dominance will have the same network effect principles in play. The two largest metaverses in terms of active users today are the Sandbox and Decentraland. Both of these metaverses have a finite supply of land, giving it value. In fact, plots of land in Decentraland have been selling for millions of dollars which is astonishing! Who would have thought that digital land would be selling for more than physical land? Once you dive into it as we will in the next sections, you will see why this isnt as crazy as you initially think. Fashion Street Estate in Decentraland sold for $3.5 Million (618,000 MANA) Image via decentraland.org As mentioned, there is finite land available in metaverses like Decentraland and the Sandbox, and similar to how a plot of land in a place like New York is going to cost considerably more than some backwoods land in the middle of nowhere that nobody wants to visit, these metaverses also have plots of land that cost more as they are in more desirable locations than others. Here is a heatmap showing cost of land in the Sandbox, highlighting that more centrally located plots are more desirable, and therefore, worth more. Image via Snoop Dogg is one of the biggest celebrities who firmly planted a flag in the metaverse. The plot of land beside his mansion in the Sandbox sold for $500k, not because there was anything particularly special about it, other than you get to be neighbours with Snoop Dogg. So, going back to the concern that we can just create another Decentraland or Sandbox, and create more virtual worlds, the network effect is powerful as there is only one Snoop Dogg, and only one tv series: The Walking Dead, and they chose to hang out in the Sandbox. There are already thousands of users in Decentraland, along with Samsung, JP Morgan, Vegas City, and gaming giant  to name a few. So yeah, we can create another world, but I want to hang out in Decentraland, playing Atari. Atari in Decentraland Image via If all your friends are in one metaverse, and gaming giant brands and entertainment companies, along with sporting events and fashion companies that are important to you are in the same metaverse, that network effect reduces the likelihood of newly created metaverses that have none of that devaluing the land owned in an already well-established blue-chip metaverse project. Supply and demand are factors that also play a role in land value within a metaverse ecosystem, but it is ultimately adoption, popularity and network effects (along with useability, of course,) that will give one metaverse value and demand over competing metaverses. These are the main factors that need to be considered when deciding whether or not digital land is a viable investment. Trying to understand why anyone would opt for digital real estate over physical real estate is a hard point to pass across the table to someone who is big on physical assets and traditional investing, and I get it. I am going to take from my own experience here and make a comparison for anyone who is interested in Bitcoin but has not made the leap to understanding the value of digital land yet, as similarities can be drawn by comparing digital land to physical land, as we can compare Bitcoin to physical cash or gold. There are a lot of people in the world whose main financial goal is to own a house with a paid-off mortgage, a sentiment that I agree with, as it is likely the best scenario for most people. Imagine all the extra disposable income you would have if you didnt need to pay rent or a mortgage. Buying a house vs renting is a topic that I have researched at length in the past and is not as black and white for everyone. For example, did you know that in Germany and Switzerland it is more favourable to rent than it is to own? Renting is Preferable to Buying in Germany and Switzerland. Image via Arguments can be made that real estate is a money pit and not always a good investment. In many countries, real estate does not appreciate as well as other assets, and since the 2008 financial crash, real estate has been steadily depreciating in some countries. In many parts of the world, investors would be better off throwing money into an index fund than purchasing a home, but these are topics for another time. Real Estate Investment Profitability is Highly Dependent on Location. Image via For me, I love the idea of having physical real estate, a tangible asset that I can live in and build on, and to know that I always have a roof over my head in case the world goes to hell in a handbasket. I would like to have one physical home for security, not necessarily as an investment, before investing in speculative digital property. Though with that being said, in full transparency for you guys as I dont want to be hypocritical, I actually own digital land and property, but no physical property, which is something I am looking to change. This wasnt entirely my choice, in my article about , I told the story about how I used to earn a salary in Bitcoin, and damn near got laughed out of the bank when I tried to apply for a mortgage. So, I thought screw it, if I cant buy a real home, Im going to buy virtual land and aped into Bloktopia and other projects where I am earning some sweet passive monthly income (more on that later). Image via Availability is a great distinction that separates physical and virtual property. For many of us, getting a mortgage or buying property can be unattainable for multiple reasons. There are far fewer barriers to entry when opting for virtual land, essentially anyone with the internet and the capital can do it. If you can spot good opportunities early, you can get in for a fraction of the cost of physical real estate and the ROI on digital land sales has smashed the physical real estate market out of the park. Some of these plots of land were purchased for mere dollars and later sold for millions, something not seen in the physical realm. If you are on board with Bitcoin, then you likely understand why it is superior to fiat money and gold due to the following principles: You can apply these same principles to digital land vs physical land. Digital land is more durable than physical land Digital land and real estate are not subject to the same hazards as physical property. No need to worry about floods, earthquakes or natural wear and tear, nor do you need to worry about upkeep and maintenance costs. Digital land is more portable than physical land Your virtual real estate can be accessed and utilized from anywhere in the world so long as you have an internet connection. Also, with cross-compatibility with NFTs, if you dont like where your digital house is built, you can pick it up and transplant it somewhere else, even between metaverses someday. Imagine saying you are tired of your apartment in New York, or your neighbourhood has become a rough area, good luck picking up your home with all its furnishings and transplanting it to another country or city. That will be theoretically possible with digital land. You can also sell or transfer your digital real estate nearly instantaneously to anyone located anywhere in the world; borders are a restriction that virtual property does not need to abide by. Digital land is more divisible With , groups of investors can share the cost and get involved with joint ownership of land and real estate far more efficiently and to a greater scalable degree than the traditional real estate industry, without pesky banks and property rights/title deed regulations getting in the way. There is nothing stopping you from drawing a contract up with a group of friends or family and entering a joint venture into digital real estate investing. Plus, with smart contracts, this can all be done in a trustless and permissionless way so you dont need to worry about people backing out of the deal or being shady. Back to the real world, there are rules and regulations in place that stipulate how many names can be on a mortgage, or how many names can be on a property title which can be a burden and a barrier. Blockchain often removes these intermediaries who enforce arbitrary rules, creating a more free and equal system. Digital real estate can have the same principles of scarcity as physical real estate As mentioned, there is a finite supply of land available in some of these metaverses, just as is the case with the real world. While a valid argument is that we can just continually create more virtual worlds, there will still be scarcity driving value if you want prime real estate in prime metaverse locations. Just for fun, here is a chart that shows what factors drive property value from a traditional perspective that we can compare to digital property:    One of the most revolutionary features of the metaverse and digital land is that virtual worlds can be created without the restrictions or restraints that are present in the physical world. Things like gravity, thermodynamics, and physics do not need to be adhered to, meaning that the only limitation is human imagination. Now, admittedly, I am not the most imaginative person on the planet, and I am sure you can come up with more creative and innovative ideas than I can, but what started opening my eyes to the possibilities of the ridiculous beauty that can exist in the metaverse was during the Cardano 2021 virtual summit. The event took place on the back of a giant turtle, surrounded by floating islands which is pretty cool imo. 2021 Cardano Summit. Image via Physical land acquisition has the burdens and hurdles of intermediaries, deeds and titles that need to be transferred, financial party interest, and endless red tape dictating what you can and cannot do with your property. We cant even begin to imagine what the full form of the metaverse will look like with the randomness of a global collaboration of the imaginations without limitations from a global population. Some metaverses will be like something out of a Dr. Seuss picture book times a million. That same imagination can be utilized to figure out the endless ways you can monetize your virtual real estate. You want an underwater M.C. Esher style home complete with friendly dolphins? You can do it, maybe charge a cheeky little entrance fee for visitors. We have already seen virtual concerts from the likes of Post Malone, who rocked out on stage with Pikachu. Ariana Grande, The Weekend, Justin Bieber and Snoop Dogg have also performed in virtual reality venues. Post Malone Performed in a Virtual Concert to Celebrate Pokmons 25th Birthday. Image via If you own a large enough parcel of land, you could be the one to rent it out for these virtual concerts, sports matches, conferences, build virtual movie theatres, arcades, bowling alleys, casinos, you name it! Advertising is also going to be paramount in the metaverse, think about all the advertising that exists on the internet today, that will all need to find a home in the metaverse. If you own land that is likely to see a lot of traffic, advertising and marketing agencies are likely to pay a fortune for the chance to put their brand up at your place. One of the common methods that I have used to earn monthly income from the metaverse is to rent out real estate to companies who want their brand seen in the metaverse. For me, this happens in Bloktopia. This works the same way as renting out office space to tenants in a physical building. My other metaverse income comes from staking and renting out  NFTs to players around the world, so there are a few different ways to capitalize here. As long as you have a piece of land in a metaverse/area that people will want to visit, the sky really is the limit for all the different ways you can monetize it. Or, for a passive approach, many investors are simply flipping digital land as it can often be purchased and then sold later for a profit. This is the million-dollar question that everybody wants to know, isnt it? The truth is, nobody has a crystal ball, and nobody knows which metaverses will succeed and which ones will fail, nor do we even know if virtual real estate is a good investment at all, which is why it is classified as high risk and highly speculative. We could all look back in ten years and go hey, remember when we were all dumb enough to buy virtual land? Then cry into our pile of Beanie Babies and Pogs that we also thought would be worth something someday. How Many People Spent Fortunes on These Thinking They Would Sell for Millions Someday? I Wouldnt Trade a Can of Beans for one Nowadays. Image via Shutterstock When weighing up metaverse investment potential, as with any risky investment, the first thing you should ask yourself is if you have enough disposable money to throw into a metaverse investment. Any money that goes into highly speculative assets like cryptocurrency should be money that you can afford to lose, which is why nearly every financial advisor and honourable crypto personality will tell you that same thing. If I had people in my life who were dependent on my income and I did not own my own home and struggled financially each month, the last thing I would be investing in is metaverse projects. If you do decide to take a crack at metaverse investing, then the traditional methods of valuing real estate should apply to your investment decision. These are things like: Location- Who are the owners of the land in your neighbourhood? Landowners in the Sandbox have raked in masses of income when big brands like Atari, Samsung, and Adidas set up shop next door. Is the location in a desirable area that you will likely be able to sell for a profit later on? Network Effects- Are there enough attractions, brands, and big names in your metaverse to continuously fuel engagement and attract users? Cost Like any investment, there are good times to buy and bad times. Many virtual real estate investors bought in at the peak of the 2021 metaverse mania only to watch the value of their properties drop significantly in value, some as much as 70% or more. Ability to Monetize- The more factors driving traffic to your area will increase your ability to monetize the property and set up additional income streams, or simply increase the value of your investment. How Long You Are Willing to Hold- Many consider metaverse investment as long term with a 5-10+ year outlook. The majority of metaverse real estate sale activity happens in the top two names in the space, Decentraland and Sandbox. These are considered the safest, blue chip metaverse investment plays. Other mentions that are gaining in popularity and growing are the likes of the Solana powered Somnium Space, , Cryptovoxels, , Bloktopia, and the Cardano powered  metaverse, along with many other fantastic looking ones in the pipeline. Image via Sandbox is the leader, dominating approximately 62% of the entire metaverse real estate market. During the 2021 virtual land boom, LAND in the Sandbox was going for an average of $11,000 for a tiny parcel, with higher-end lots going for six figures. Since the hype has died down, Sandbox LAND is now selling for an average price of $3,100. Image via The figures look similar for Decentraland with the average price for a small land plot going for just over $3,000, with some big-ticket estates recently going for $182,000. Not bad considering the initial land offering price was around $20. Being able to turn twenty bucks into six figures is one of the drivers behind metaverse land investing hype for those who are lucky enough to get in early and pick the winners. Image via While the investment may be worth the risk for many, I do think the excitement and hype about the metaverse tends to cloud the logical judgement of many in the space as so many people fomod in. There is also the question of whether or not metaverse interest will ever again reach the euphoria stage seen in 2021, as interest in the entire NFT, crypto and metaverse space has waned in 2022. Search Trends for NFTs and Metaverse are on the Decline. Image via Investing in virtual real estate is much easier than physical real estate and can be done within minutes. All you need to do is: Then of course, once you have your plot of land you can sit and hodl it or build on it until your hearts content.  The metaverse is a very exciting concept as it is something new that we cannot quite grasp the full potential or limitless nature of. But like every new technological revolution and evolution, this type of investment carries high risk. With so much development and building happening in the space as everyone rushes to become part of what could be a multi-trillion-dollar industry, it is almost guaranteed that many projects will not make it, adding another layer of risk to investors. Much like how over 90% of early internet companies have failed, many metaverse and cryptocurrency companies are likely to follow the same fate. For investors able to stomach the risk and volatility, metaverse and digital land investing offers more opportunities for revenue streams, monetization, and higher ROI potential than what is available with physical real estate. It can also be done significantly more efficiently than physical real estate investing, with clicks of a button done in minutes, instead of mountains of paperwork, red tape, and intermediates overcomplicating a process that can take weeks or months. If you are someone whose whole life is spent online, then increasing your virtual presence and investing in metaverse land could be a logical next step. But for many who still want to participate in real life, and do things like raise a family, have friends over for Sunday BBQs, and things like that, spending thousands on virtual property, and needing to spend hours online to manage your digital investments may not be the best call, especially if you do not have a physical and stable property secured for your real-life adventure game. I am a big fan of those post-apocalyptic and zombie-themed TV shows and books, and I do often find myself questioning my asset acquisition in life. As I mentioned earlier, there is something to be said for the security and safety of your physical self. If all hell breaks loose tomorrow and zombies, invading armies, pirates, bandits, or zombie pirate bandits come strolling into town, I am pretty sure that my Bitcoin and NFTs likely arent going to get me very far, and one cannot seek refuge in a virtual home, so I often feel that it is a good idea to get your physical life sorted and secure before going all-in on speculative fairy tale lands that exist in cyberspaceAlways good to have a fallback plan.

It has been noted that despite bearish prices across the crypto sector, institutional investment and development in the space seems to be unphased by the lacklustre price action, and institutional money is more bullish than ever on the crypto sector. As crypto exchanges , , and  expand operations, and VC firms a16z, Babel Finance, and Huobi Ventures pour billions of dollars into funds that , Tron is the only major network that is showing bullish price behaviour that reflects the behind-the-scenes bullish confidence in the space. Tron Passes Solana, Polygon and Avalanche in Value Locked. Image via Tron competitor  fell by over 22% last week, while ,  and  all experienced a fall of over 12%. Even the benchmark Bitcoin fell 4.6% while Tron jumped over 11% in a seemingly impossible task. Much of this attention is caused by Trons Terra-style algorithmic stablecoin, USDD, that Tron founder Justin Sun  would be launching at the beginning of May. It would appear that  was not enough to dispel crypto enthusiasts desire for an algorithmic stablecoin, as crypto users flood into Tron to utilize another stablecoin that many feel is nothing but a ticking time bomb waiting to follow Terras fate. It looks as if many investors may have written Tron off too quickly in the previous bull run as TRX has highlighted itself as the clear winner in recent months. While every top ten cryptocurrency aside from stablecoins are down over 10% month-to-date, Tron is up over 30%. Looking at the year-to-date paints a similar picture, BTC is down over 35%, ETH is down over 50%, but TRX has risen 7.5%, a clear outlier across altcoins. Trons increase to $5.99b in TVL gives it the third-largest DeFi ecosystem, with only Ethereum and the BSC network ahead of it. Tron will need to see significant development on the network if it wants to hold onto the number 3 spot as it has a notably smaller ecosystem compared to its ETH and BSC counterparts, with only 9 projects in the Tron ecosystem currently active vs the over 350 on both BSC and Ethereum.

This increase marks a 15% gain from the 18-month low Bitcoin reached in the middle of May and investors are wondering if this is simply a relief rally, or if there is more fuel in the tank. Since Bitcoin hit its all-time high in November of last year, the entire cryptocurrency market cap has shed more than $1.5 trillion, with Bitcoin experiencing a decrease of over 60% over the past 6 months, with most altcoins faring far worse.

Some more consolidation here and were ready to break further upwards in which $32.8K and $35K are the resistances.

12,2022-05-30,The 8 Best Desktop Wallets in 2022,https://www.coinbureau.com/review/best-crypto-desktop-wallets/," Believe it or not, there are still many out there not spooked by recent market conditions and are doubling down on their efforts, including me. I look at these prices and think: yay, Black Friday sale! After all, the foundation for fortunes comes from bearish times, with the riches reaped during bullish periods. Having bought a bunch of tokens, the next thing to do is hunt for a good wallet to store them in. When it comes to wallet types, there are primarily two types: cold and hot wallets. The former refers to hardware wallets that come in the form of a USB stick and a desktop application as the UI for it. The latter are divided into mobile wallets, browser-extension/web wallets, and desktop wallets. In this article, we are going to focus on the last kind.  Page Contents  [] The easiest way to think about desktop wallets is that they are wallet apps designed for computers. Technically- speaking, there are no mobile versions, so users cant easily access it across multiple devices. However, some wallet developers want to offer users the option of a mobile app if they so desire. My suggestion is that if you choose the desktop version, ignore the mobile app. As inconvenient as it may seem, its also more secure because theres only one way to access it. I would swap convenience for security any day when safeguarding my precious crypto assets. There are a few things to consider when looking to get a desktop wallet. Some of these considerations are based on your purpose for getting the wallet in the first place. Some wallets only support one type of crypto, mainly Bitcoin or Ethereum. Other wallets support every token traded on major exchanges. Unfortunately, this usually doesnt include newer tokens that only get listed in DEXs. When I first came across, I didnt realise until later that its an example of afull nodewallet. Whenever I boot it up to check on my ADA holdings, its downloading a copy of the Cardano blockchain onto my laptop. Unfortunately, the bigger the blockchain got, the longer it took to access the wallet on my poor laptop. Unless you are looking to run a full blockchain node yourself, I would say that a full node wallet isnt something suited for everyone. For example, most of us use our wallets to transfer funds or do some staking. In this case, theSimple Payment Verificationtype would be sufficient to suit our needs. Most wallets in the market are of this type. It verifies that a transaction is in the blockchain without downloading the entire blockchain. Its standard to assume that any desktop wallet worth its salt should at least have seed phrase protection. You are also given a recovery phrase to access your wallet if your computer is stolen or destroyed. Going one step up would be 2FA. Short for Two-Factor Authentication, the two-factor part refers to what you know and what you have. A password is an example of the former, and an Authenticator app like Google Authenticator or Authy is the latter. The app generates a 6-digit code entered in the wallets interface as proof of having something. Some wallets even come with themultisigoption. Short for multi-signature, its not enough for one person to sign a transaction independently. Instead, the number of people established initially all need to sign the transaction to show complete agreeance for the transaction to go through. That way, even if one person is compromised, the funds still cant be moved. As long as something is online, getting hacked is always possible, even if that possibility might be quite low. If the desktop wallet is connected with a hardware wallet, this greatly decreases the risk of stolen funds since it still boils down to what you have. In this case, funds transfer needs to be approved with the USB device that is the cold wallet. Hackers from afar would be unable to get their hands on this device.  Check that the funds you want to protect are in the account or wallet address connected to the hardware wallet. For example, with browser-extension wallets, the connected account is not necessarily the default account, so you will need to transfer funds to the correct account. No matter how secure the desktop wallet is, if the UI is poorly-designed, its not going to have many people using it, which defeats the purpose of its existence in the first place. It needs to have a certain level of intuition that most people can grasp without resorting to watching how-to-use videos on YouTube. When things go wrong, as they sometimes will, reaching out to someone who can look into your problem is a great relief. One of the most common reasons for wanting to talk to customer support is when funds dont show up as expected, especially if you can see that it was a successful transfer on the blockchain explorer. Email support would be the bare minimum. Chat support would be better but dont hold your hopes up for phone support. Unless there is a financial entity behind the wallet, who will pay for the staff to chat with you? Aside from providing a safe space for you to store your funds and allowing you to send and receive funds, some wallets also have other functions like crypto-trading or staking. These wallets integrate with a trading platform so that you can trade while still retaining custody of your funds. Theres also no need to trade on a decentralised exchange which entails going to a different website. However, this is not the cheapest option. I guess thats the price for both convenience and security. Nothing is perfect and expecting anything like that is just an invitation to disappointment. Here are some of the things to watch out for when using desktop wallets: Now that we have covered most of the bases lets get cracking looking at whats available to choose from in the marketplace! Before Satoshi, there was. Or so they would like to claim. In reality, the first  was launched in August 2014., the same year Mt Gox went kaput. Having been around the block, it is one of two top hardware wallets in the industry. Sorry if I have to cheat a bit here by including it in this article, but it has a desktop interface and doesnt come with a mobile version, so lets just let that slide, shall we? The wallet comes with what looks like a fancy car key as the hardware component. This is paired with the desktop app for managing the assets supported by the wallet. The interface is relatively clean and straightforward and supports pretty much any token under the sun. One of the leading industry standards for wallets. Image via Trezor Aside from retail owners, Trezor is also used by many significant enterprises and endorsed by Coindesk, Forbes etc. If these companies trust Trezor to do their job, there is no reason for you and me not to. Trezors no. 1 competitor is, and Im sure the feeling is mutual between them. The company started in 2014, the same year as Trezor and is based in Paris, France. The desktop app, known as Ledger Live, is the interface for their hardware wallet, of which there are three models. Through the app, you can stake, swap assets and even manage your NFTs directly. Unlike Trezor, which needs to rely on a third-party intermediary like Metamask to manage NFTs, you can send, receive and see your NFTs in the Ledger Live app. However, only Ethereum and Polygon-based NFTs are supported currently. Another function in the wallet is that you can buy bitcoin directly in  through their partnership with Coinify and Wyre via credit/debit card. One of the things that always makes me antsy about buying bitcoin is the time it takes to transfer it from wherever to the Ledger wallet (Disclaimer: I own a Ledger wallet). So being able to go from buying to storing in a cold wallet in one shot is as safe as it goes for making a crypto purchase. However, the rates arent always the best as its pretty much a spot purchase, i.e. buying based on market rate and the fees are also something to consider. Robust security and an easy-to-understand interface. Image via Ledger In my early days of getting my feet wet in crypto, that was when I heard about. At the time, I thought all it had was the mobile version. Only much later did I find out that they have a desktop version. Unlike other wallets that simply list Linux as one of the supporting operating systems, they listed specific Linux distro packages such as Fedora, Ubuntu and Debian. That tells you how serious they are when it comes to the business of desktop wallets. Its also a prime example of a wallet providing more than just the basics. Aside from supporting a variety of tokens, they allow users to buy crypto with a regular credit card with a 1% cashback. After purchasing the tokens, you can also earn some juicy staking rewards directly in the wallet. Please note that they only support 13 tokens for staking currently, so check first before you buy if this is what youre interested in. The most unique feature about Atomic that is not found with the other wallets (yet?) is their native token AWC. With a current price of$0.535, it is a BEP-20 token. Earn up to 20% staking the token with Atomic and get 1% cashback for exchanging tokens in the app. Theres even a hint of a referral program coming soon! Theres not as much talk about their security features as some of the wallets do, so while Im sure its as safe as they can make it to be, Id likely only store enough crypto in it as a way of diversification, but that I wont lose sleep over if anything were to happen. A multi-asset wallet that does more than just store tokens. Image via Medium.com/Thorchain One of the most well-known bitcoin wallets, Electrum is a multi-sig wallet with cold storage capability for storing your precious bitcoin. Although it also has a mobile version, were just going to focus on the desktop version for our current purposes. They partner with TrustedCoin in providing the 2FA service. How the multi-sig wallet works is that it has three keys. The user owns two of the three keys, and the third key is in a remote server. A small fee is charged for every transaction using that server. Featuring a no-frills UI and integration with Trezor and Ledger for additional security, this is a basic wallet for all things Bitcoin, including the. When setting up the wallet, you can choose from a series of options. As basic as it comes but gets the job done. Image via Electrum app One of the most popular wallets around, I know quite a number of people who swear by . Its also a top wallet recommended by many in the know, including Investopedia, for beginner users, according to their website. The wallet comes with both a desktop and mobile option but feel free to ignore the latter if you choose the former. Its also integrated with Trezor to provide an extra layer of security. What struck me about the wallet is that it makes full use of the space allocated for a desktop app. Aside from showing the portfolio with key numbers, you can also see the chart for a chosen asset and other useful information. While there is quite a bit of info packed into it, the layout is still pleasing to the eye and, more importantly, not overwhelming. 200+ assets in a colorful yet elegant interface. Image via Exodus Not content with being just a multi-asset wallet supporting more than 200 assets, Exodus also features an exchange within the wallet, allowing for easy swaps between assets without any additional sign-in or navigating to other pages. This is an integration with, giving you access to the exchanges features without signing up for an account with them. Another partnership that benefits users is withby allowing them to earn yield from the DAI in their wallet. Sports-betting is also possible with Exodus, and not just for regular sports such as baseball, basketball etc., but also for E-sports like League of Legends. In the meantime, other apps are in development and will no doubt be unveiled when they are ready. A key selling point of the wallet to newbies is its 24/7 human support. They also have an extensive Knowledge Base section that includes a section on blockchain education so users can learn a bit more about the assets they have. If I were a newbie, I would consider using Exodus.  Every now and then, Id come across certain things that seemed to pop up repeatedly. Thewallet is one of those. Its a wallet under most peoples radar, yet the reviews are mostly positive, as seen on this page from. The wallet is aimed at the mainstream crowd with the following features: The website also features quite a sizeable section on crypto education where one can learn about crypto basics, written in pedestrian language, i.e. language that most people understand. This messaging is consistent with their approach of being the wallet for the everyday Joe. Customers can talk to someone via Live Chat to answer any questions or concerns they may have. At the same time, email support is available during the after-hours period. A wallet for the everyday Joe  Image via Guarda One of the things you might notice as you browse the homepage foris its claim to being the oldest multi-asset wallet. It was established in 2014, which in most cases, being less than a decade old, doesnt seem much, but in crypto-land, where six months is equivalent to 1.2 years in normal speed, that does seem shy of being next to the dinosaurs. It also makes it impressive and maybe suitable for the casual crypto user because it supports a wide range of fiat currencies in more than 20 languages. With versions available for Windows, Mac and Linux, it is one of the wallets on this list that has a decent social presence, with communication channels on Facebook, Twitter, Telegram, Reddit and Instagram, pretty much covering all the major age and gender groups, with TikTok being the only channel they dont have a presence. Additionally, they offer 24/7 live support, undoubtedly music to a beginners ears, as they can expect some handholding when exploring the wallets features. They also feature YouTube tutorials if you prefer to learn by watching than reading. All the reasons to use Coinomi listed in colorful headings. Image via Coinomi Some interesting features of the wallet include: Nice UI to attract some eyeballs. Image via Coinomi Thewallet is another single-asset desktop wallet for storing Bitcoin with cold storage and multi-sig support. They pioneered managing Bitcoin offline with a computer that never touches the internet. Instead, transactions are made with a watching-only wallet, but the private keys themselves are stored in the offline computer. This greatly reduces the attack surface for hackers. The source code for the wallet is open-source and available for audit and views on GitHub. So in the unlikely event the entity behind it goes under, it is still possible to access your funds with a bit of know-how. The website also has a tutorial section on using the wallet for various functions. As it was designed for developers to use, the UI is very basic. But enough to do what needs to be done. When it comes to security, though, its pretty top-of-the-line. Given the opportunity, I wouldnt mind storing my bitcoin in this wallet. For a free wallet, its as good as it gets. A free wallet with top-notch security for your bitcoin. Image via Armory Weve covered some of the more well-known ones available in the market. It is by no means an extensive list but to give you an idea of what is considered standard functionality and what is a unique selling point. Most importantly, its about finding a wallet that fits your needs, and its ok if no single wallet fulfils all of them. In fact, it might not be a bad idea to diversify a bit by having two or even three wallets for your crypto. That way, if anything bad were to happen to one of them, youd still have your assets safe in other wallets.

There has been a popular mantra followed by many in the cryptocurrency space that goes along the lines of needing to move fast and break things, when dealing with technology as revolutionary and impactful as blockchain. Crypto has, indeed, been moving fast, and a lot has been broken. With seemingly endless hacks, exploits, rug pulls, project failures, and , Charles Hoskinson reconfirms his stance on why crypto projects should move slowly and ensure that they get things right the first time, so people stop losing money and confidence in the crypto sector. Charles Hoskinson at a Ted Talk About Why the Future Will be Decentralized. Image via Popular projects such as  and  notably follow this moving fast mantra. The result has been projects and products being quick to market, but experiencing issues that plague the crypto community such as atrociously high network fees, and in the case of Solana, Projects that take a more educational, peer-reviewed, and research-based approach are the likes of  and , who act more like the tortoise than the hare in the fabled race between the two. These projects have come under scrutiny from impatient investors and users as they have been slower in their development and release to market, but with the aim of theoretically producing a more robust network that should see fewer issues than their rushing competitors. In a recent  with Coindesk, Hoskinson pointed out why we need to be more careful stating: If you move too quickly, as weve seen with Luna, and weve seen withlast year, you could actually get it to work until it doesnt, and then when it doesnt its a catastrophic failure and everybody loses their money In contrast, Hoskinson said that he and his company IOG (formerly IOHK) are moving deliberately in building the Cardano network playing the long arc game, measured not in weeks or months, but in years to decades. We always say its not first, its best out of the gate who succeeds, Hoskinson said. The people who are going to survive are those who are tested under stress and exhibit resiliency. Hoskinsons Cardano project is one of the most closely watched in the industry, amassing vast amounts of attention from retail and institutional investors alike partly thanks to Grayscales Smart Contract Platform Fund. Earlier this year, Grayscale launched an Ethereum alternative fund that houses Polkadot, Algorand, and Solana, with the largest weighting going to Cardano at 25.35% Image via Hoskinson is also one of the highly anticipated speakers who will be attending Consensus 2022 in Texas this June.

14,2022-05-30,Bitcoin and Stocks: Not the Decoupling We Were Hoping For,https://www.coinbureau.com/news/bitcoin-and-stocks-not-the-decoupling-we-were-hoping-for/," Bitcoin has been showing a strong relationship to the stock market in recent months, with a notably strong correlation in performance with the Nasdaq. But last weeks market data suggests that this correlation is weakening and could be coming to an end. For a long time, crypto enthusiasts have been keen to see a decoupling in the relationship between Bitcoin and traditional financial markets so Bitcoin can live up to its potential narrative of being an , , and a useful asset to hold as part of a . Bitcoins performance in recent months has gone hand in hand with the greater stock market, reducing its effectiveness in the mentioned narratives. When stocks are up, BTC price has gone up, and when stocks drop, Bitcoin typically follows suit. A Look at Bitcoin vs the Nasdaq composite index. Image via This past week saw green action across the stock markets, with the Nasdaq up 3.1%, while Bitcoin has fallen 3%, not exactly the sort of decoupling we have been hoping for. The United States Commerce Department released  on May 27th, showing that personal savings rates fell to 4.4% in April, reaching the lowest levels since 2008. This has sparked fear among investors and crypto traders that worsening global macroeconomic conditions could lead to further aversion for capital allocation to risk-on assets, which is how Bitcoin is viewed by many institutional investors. One of Bitcoins strongest narratives that we are yet to see play out is as a viable risk-off asset class, a store of value similar to the likes of Gold that could lead to further inflows of institutional money into the asset. A further decoupling could help drive this narrative to fruition. As institutional investors have been cautiously dipping their toes into the Bitcoin pool, the asset has been largely treated as a risk-on asset, along with tech and speculative growth stocks, which has led to Bitcoin seeing similar buying and selling patterns. Bitcoin holders often argue against the asset being treated as a similar speculative gamble and feel that institutions are failing to see Bitcoins true potential. While one week of data is not enough to make any definite conclusions, this new inverse correlation is interesting to see. It appears that for the past week, for better or for worse, Wall Street agreed with the sentiment that Bitcoin should not be placed in the same basket as other assets.

In  for a testimony to the Committee on Financial Services in Washington, Brainard alluded to the recent  (UST) debacle that wiped out over $50 billion in wealth, and used it as an example of why comprehensive regulation should exist for stablecoins. There has been explosive growth in an emergent digital financial system built around new digital assets and facilitated by crypto-asset platforms and stablecoins as settlement assets, she said. Two widely used stablecoins have come under considerable pressure. One widely used algorithmic stablecoin declined to a small fraction of its purported value, and the stablecoin that is the most traded crypto asset by volume temporarily dipped below its purported one-to-one valuation with the dollar. Image via Shutterstock According to Brainard, these events highlight the need for clear regulator guardrails to provide consumer and investor protection, protect financial stability, and ensure a level playing field for competition and innovation across the financial system. The Fed official said that currently, there may not be an immediate need for a , but that in the future, there could be conditions that may give rise to such a need. We recognize there are risks of not acting, just as there are risks of acting. Brainard suggested that if stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies  what she refers to as private monies  rise to prominence and become widespread, there may be a fragmentation of the US payment system into so-called walled gardens. If and when private money does rise to prominence, Brainard hinted that it could coexist with CBDCs, and the two asset classes could ultimately complement each other. In a way, cryptocurrencies in some nations are already complimenting CBDCs as governments enter a race to digitize their money system. In Norway, Norges Bank has already  a CBDC pilot that runs on an Ethereum layer-2 protocol called Nahmii, stating: We are planning further development projects based on the same technology. The technology will be particularly relevant for collaboration with alliance partners (including banks) and as a basis for a sandbox. The plan is for the prototype infrastructure to be made available as open source code  hopefully during the summer of 2022. This will facilitate alliance partners and the public to participate more broadly in the testing.

The notion that were going to solve everything for blockchain or for digital assets through this executive orderthats a lot of expectation that will be disappointed, Kraninger said. Sulolit Mukherjee, vice president and global head of tax at , said he sympathized with the difficult job that regulators had. Mukherjee had this to say: Im not saying that theyre not going to be useful, but education is an ongoing moving target in the blockchain space. I empathize with the challenges of the folks in these agencies who now have to sort of go out there learn this technology, keep up with the tremendously fast pace of innovation and then come up with recommendations. Its a long game, I think its going to take a while before we get full clarity of what the regulatory framework is going to look like. Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of San Francisco-based Ripple Labs which is in the middle of a lawsuit with the SEC,  on Tuesday that the US regulatory environment was somewhere between hostile and uncertain. In terms of regulatory certainty, the US is behind other countries. There is much better clarity in Japan, Singapore and Switzerland to invest, he said.

20,2022-05-25,European Central Bank Report Reveals 10% of Eurozone Owns Crypto Assets,https://www.coinbureau.com/news/european-central-bank-report-reveals-10-of-eurozone-owns-crypto-assets/," The European Central Bank released a new report on the state of cryptocurrency, saying that the  of the space emphasizes the importance of understanding its risks. The report, titled Decrypting financial stability risks in crypto-asset markets, while mostly a critique and warning of the industry, does reveal some bullish metrics. For example, the ECB says that based on results from its recent Consumer Expectation Survey (CES) from six larger eurozone countries, as much as 10% of households may own crypto-assets Most crypto-asset owners reported holding less than 5,000 in crypto-assets, with a slight predominance of smaller holdings (below 1,000) in this group, they said. At the other end of the spectrum, around 6% of crypto-asset owners confirmed that they held more than 30,000 in crypto-assets. Looking at the income quintiles of the respondents, the pattern is largely U-shaped: the higher a households income, the more likely it is to hold crypto-assets, with lower-income households more likely to hold crypto than middle-income households. Image via According to the , young adult males and highly educated respondents were more likely to invest in crypto-assets from the countries surveyed. It also found that respondents were either at the top level of financial literacy or at the bottom, similar to the U-shape found in their income disparities. On the other hand, the ECB says: Crypto-assets lack intrinsic economic value or reference assets, while their frequent use as an instrument of speculation, their high volatility and energy consumption, and their use in financing illicit activities make crypto-assets highly risky instruments. This also raises concerns over money laundering, market integrity and consumer protection, and may have implications for financial stability. The government body reiterated that crypto assets are not suitable for most retail investors, either as an investment or store of value, warning that they could lose a large amount of the money they have invested. The ECB also listed all the usual alleged risks associated with crypto, including misleading information, the absence of rights and protections such as complaints procedures or recourse mechanisms, and product complexity with leverage sometimes embedded.

23,2022-05-23,"Crypto Winter Here to Stay For A While, Says Delta Blockchain Head",https://www.coinbureau.com/news/crypto-winter-here-to-stay-for-a-while-says-delta-blockchain-head/," Kavita Gupta, founder of the Delta Blockchain Fund and FINTECH.TV, believes crypto has officially entered a winter which will last for a significant amount of time. Speaking in an interview with Bloomberg Technology, Gupta said she thought it was just the beginning of a crypto winter to be very honest and was surprised at how many people believed Bitcoin would hold support at $30,000. I do expect it to go down to somewhere between $14k, $18k, maybe $22k as a stable point but remember we have seen this the past two times. This is nothing new right, every time it goes up to an all-time high there is a point when it comes down to and finds the new lower point as a base point to stand around. I still feel that we have already entered crypto winter and were gonna stay here for at least a year to a year and a half. Gupta, who started the Delta Fund in 2021 after receiving $50 million in commitments,  that she isnt expecting  to get back above $45,000 for another year or so. I believe this is the time when people are gonna build and theyre gonna have a lot of technology with major adoption. Look at what FTX just announced which is going to bring a lot more people into the space and that adoption is going to trigger us back to another big high cycle. Image via Shutterstock Gupta isnt alone in her bearish outlook for crypto, and there are classic  that back her sentiment up, including the death cross. A death cross occurs when the 50 period moving average crosses below the 200 moving average. The opposite is called a golden cross. While a death cross is generally considered a confirmation of a bearish trend by some technical analysts, some argue that it is a lagging indicator or something that simply tells everyone what they already know. Pseudonymous crypto analyst Rekt Capital said in a  that death crosses can either signal further capitulation or occasionally catch traders off guard and give completely false signals. With the death cross already occurring in Bitcoin, the analyst gave a complete summary of what happened during each death cross in Bitcoins history. Summary: 2013: BTC drops -73% pre-Death Cross BTC drops extra -70% post-DC 2017: -70% pre-DC -65% post-DC 2019: -53% pre-DC -55% post-DC 2020: -63% pre-DC +1581% post-DC 2021: -56% pre-DC +141% post-DC 2022: -43% pre-DC ? post-DC Whats interesting about the scenario of a -43% post-Death Cross crash however is that it would result in a $22000 BTC, he said. Which ties in with the 200-SMA (orange) which tends to offer fantastic opportunities with outsized ROI for $BTC investors (green circles highlight this) Rekt Capital ",coinbureau,coinbureau,bitcoin,Neutral,"{'source': 'coinbureau', 'readtime': '3 min read', 'category': 'News'}",News,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

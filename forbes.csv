Johnson, who filed the lawsuit in New York, is seeking class-action status for the suit and aims to represent other allegedly harmed investors. He's asking for $86 billion in damages, along with triple damages of $172 billion, as well as an order blocking Musk, Tesla and SpaceX from promoting dogecoin.  [Dogecoin   is] simply a fraud whereby 'greater fools' are deceived into buying the coin at a higher price,  the lawsuit read before going on to list Musk's multiple tweets and public statements that have pushed up the dogecoin price over the last 18 months. Musk, who was voted  dogecoin CEO  in a joke Twitter poll in 2019 and adopted the moniker  The Dogefather,  has been a fan of the tongue-in-cheek bitcoin rival for years, naming dogecoin as his favorite cryptocurrency. Musk has previously said he personally owns dogecoin, along with bitcoin and ethereum. In early 2021, Musk sent the bitcoin price sharply higher when it was revealed Tesla had bought $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin. Last year, as a bitcoin, ethereum and broad cryptocurrency bull run pushed prices to blistering highs, Musk repeatedly called on dogecoin developers to upgrade the cryptocurrency in order to  beat bitcoin hands down.

The bitcoin price has this week crashed towards $20,000 per bitcoin, a psychological barrier that bitcoin first topped in late 2017 before entering a three-year bear market. Ethereum and other major cryptocurrencies, including top ten coins BNB  , XRP  , solana and cardano, have also crashed back, wiping around $400 billion from the combined crypto market in the last seven days. This week, Arthur Hayes, the influential co-founder of the bitcoin and crypto exchange BitMEX, warned of  massive selling pressure  if the bitcoin price breaks below $20,000 telling traders they  might as well shut down [their] computer.

If these levels break, you might as well shut down your computer because your charts will be useless for a while,  Hayes said.  We can expect massive sell pressure in the spot markets as dealers hedge themselves,  added Hayes, warning that severe losses could cause some trading desks to  go belly up.  Bitcoin, ethereum and other cryptocurrencies have suffered an almighty crash over the last week as higher-than-expected inflation data pushed the Federal Reserve towards a more hawkish program of interest rate rises than previously anticipated in an attempt to arrest soaring prices. On Wednesday, the Fed hiked interest rates by 75 basis points, its highest single increase since the 1990s. Global stock markets have also come under increased pressure this week, with major U.S. indices entering bear markets.  The Fed has ditched its previous guidance and opted for a full-throated 0.75% interest rate rise,  Laith Khalaf, head of investment analysis at broker AJ Bell, wrote in emailed comments.  The S&P 500 is now in bear market territory, so its evident that investors are beginning to think the unthinkable, that monetary policy might actually stand a chance of reaching levels last seen prior to the financial crisis.

Ever since the crypto rally in November, crypto has been on a ruthless downtrend with little sign of relief.  The huge bitcoin and crypto crash this past week has been exacerbated by liquidity problems at major crypto lender Celsius. Celsius, which pays out interest on bitcoin, ethereum and other cryptocurrencies users store on the platform, this week blocked customers from withdrawing funds, citing  extreme market conditions.   The market remains justifiably fearful of the potential impacts of Celsius becoming insolvent, whilst still having billions of assets under management,  Sotiriou added.",forbes,ethereum,Negative,"{'source': 'forbes', 'author': 'Billy Bambrough', 'views': '11,093', 'summary': 'Arthur Hayes, the influential co-founder of the bitcoin and crypto exchange BitMEX, warned of ""massive selling pressure"" if the bitcoin price breaks below $20,000...'}",Billy Bambrough,"11,093","Arthur Hayes, the influential co-founder of the bitcoin and crypto exchange BitMEX, warned of ""massive selling pressure"" if the bitcoin price breaks below $20,000...",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1

The bitcoin price briefly crashed to under $21,000 per bitcoin, its lowest since late 2020 while the ethereum price plunged under $1,100. Both bitcoin and ethereum have slightly bounced back but remain down 24% and 31% respectively over the last week alone, dragging on other major cryptocurrencies BNB  , XRP  , solana and cardano.

PROMOTED   Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell has sent the bitcoin price sharply lower in recent months as ... [+] the Fed gears up for an aggressive round of interest rate hikes. The bitcoin crash has sent ethereum, BNB, XRP, solana and cardano all lower.  There is a lot riding on the Federal Reserves policy update tomorrow,  Russ Mould, investment director at the broker AJ Bell, wrote in emailed comments.  Investors look as if they increasingly fear the central bank will become more aggressive with the pace of interest rates to try and curb inflation, given Mays cost of living figures were higher than expected.  The Fed, led by chairman Jerome Powell, will meet on Wednesday following Friday's inflation data that showed U.S. consumer prices rose at their fastest pace since 1981 in May. Ahead of last week's data, economists had widely forecast an interest rate hike of 50 basis points, however, many raised their expectations on Monday once they had time to digest the data.  We believe that risk-management considerations call for aggressive action to reinforce the Feds inflation-fighting credibility, Barclays economists wrote in a report out Monday seen by the , pointing to the  risks of prolonged inflation  intensifying. and justifying a larger rate rise. JPMorgan, meanwhile, called the risk of a full 100-basis point increase  non-trivial,  in a note seen by .

More rate hikes from the Fed will send most risk assets lower,  Anthony Denier, the chief executive of trading platform Webull, said via email.  The Fed is already planning to raise interest rates a significant amount to battle inflation, but this higher read may force the Fed to hike rates 75 basis points at its next meeting, instead of the expected 50 basis points. Rising interest rates are bad for risk assets.  The bitcoin and crypto market, including the likes of ethereum, BNB, XRP, solana and cardano, has moved in tandem with stock markets since the Fed announced it would begin tapering its pandemic-era simulus measures late last year, destroying the theory that bitcoin and to a lesser extent ethereum, BNB, XRP, solana and cardano had begun acting as a hedge against inflation.  Cryptos, contrary to the myths built up over the last few years, are not a hedge against inflation. Instead, we have discovered they are very closely correlated with equities, especially tech stocks. So, when stocks fall, so do cryptos. And with stocks posting big losses, cryptos do too.

The Block has . Crypto lending platform Celsius'  cryptocurrency has lost a face-melting 50% over the last 24 hours due to the platform suspending withdrawals, citing  extreme market conditions,  sparking fears of an imminent collapse. See below for details.  Representatives of the Celsius crypto network were at Paris Blockchain Week in April this year. Major crypto lending platform Celsius has suspended all withdrawals from its platform due to what it called  extreme market conditions  as cryptocurrency prices go into free fall and users rush to get their coins off the platform.  We are taking this action today to put Celsius in a better position to honor, over time, its withdrawal obligations,  the company said in a , adding it needed time to  stabilize liquidity and operations.

Here're some important headlines you might have missed.     Wall Street giant JPMorgan is gearing up to bring trillions of dollars of tokenized assets into the world of blockchain-based decentralized finance (DeFi) as it looks to tap the yield-generating potential of non-crypto assets  with the scale of institutional assets.    Over time, we think tokenizing U.S. Treasurys or money market fund shares, for example, means these could all potentially be used as collateral in DeFi pools,  Tyrone Lobban, head of Onyx Digital Assets at JPMorgan,  on stage at Coindesk's Consensus 2022 conference in Austin, Texas ().  The overall goal is to bring these trillions of dollars of assets into DeFi, so that we can use these new mechanisms for trading, borrowing [and] lending, but with the scale of institutional assets.   JPMorgan, after  quietly  exploring digital identity in the context of blockchain and digital assets over the last two years, is trying to balance traditional finance's know-your-customer (KYC) rules with DeFi and crypto's permissionless lending pools.   Look out for these cryptocurrency and crypto-adjacent events this week.  Tomorrow, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chairman, Gary Gensler, will deliver remarks on the SEC's agenda at  organized by the Wall Street Journal.

On Thursday, the U.K.'s Bank of England will make its interest rate decision. While it's expected to follow the Fed in raising rates, the latest economic growth numbers out this morning, revealing the U.K.'s economy contracted by 0.3% in April after it shrank by 0.1% in March, have increased the possibility it will put its planned hikes on hold. - ",forbes,ethereum,Positive,"{'source': 'forbes', 'author': 'Billy Bambrough', 'views': '39,178', 'summary': 'The following is an excerpt from the daily CryptoCodex email newsletter.

The Federal Reserve is backed into a corner now,  crypto investor and influencer Anthony Pompliano wrote in his newsletter after the latest inflation data was released. On Friday, data showed prices in the U.S. rose faster than expected in May, rising to 8.6% after easing in April, fueled by rising energy and food costs and pushing inflation to its highest rate since 1981.  Inflation hasnt subsided even though the Fed has been increasing interest rates and conducting quantitative tightening. They dont have many more options other than to simply put their foot on the gas. The Fed could try to accelerate the interest rate increases, both in speed and severity, along with accelerate quantitative tightening. Im not sure that they will do it, but there arent many other avenues to pursue.  Next week, the Fed is expected to raise its interest rate to 1.25%-1.50%, after a similar move last month. A  survey found economists are forecasting a further 50 basis point rate hike in July.  [Friday's] inflation report is the last big release before the Fed meeting next Wednesday,  Alex Kuptsikevich, FxPro senior market analyst, wrote in an emailed note.  A renewal of inflation to 40-year highs will surely attract the public's attention at the weekend and will pressure the Fed.

The bitcoin, ethereum and crypto market has been falling steadily over the last six months, crashing along with the stock market as the Federal Reserve and other central banks around the world hike interest rates and begin to taper pandemic-era stimulus measures. The Fed this month started to the long process of shrinking its swollen $9 trillion balance sheet, known as quantitative tightening.  Bitcoin's ongoing correlation with macro-forces-roiled stock markets has snuffed optimism and sparked frustration at a time when crypto seems to be missing the perfect opportunity to demonstrate its forgotten role as a hedge against inflation,  Rich Blake, financial consultant at crypto platform Uphold, wrote in emailed comments.

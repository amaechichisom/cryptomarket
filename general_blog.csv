1,2022-06-07,"Crypto.com Review 2022: A Robust All-in-One Crypto Solution",https://www.coinbureau.com/review/crypto-com-mco/," If youve been around the crypto space for more than a day, chances are youve heard of Crypto.com, which is what brings you to this Crypto.com review. After all, they have the word crypto, right in the name, a brilliant marketing move no doubt. The domain crypto.com was actually registered all the way back in 1993 by Matt Blaze (cool name!), who was a well-known cryptographer, and possible fortune teller as he knew that crypto was going to be big someday, purchasing the domain before anyone really even knew what the heck crypto was. So, how did the domain name Crypto.com go from being owned by a guy with a superhero name to becoming owned by one of the most well-established, well-respected crypto behemoths in the world? That is exactly what we are going to dive into today, the full breakdown of the robust Crypto.com platform, the history, the features, and more. Disclaimer: I use the Crypto.com card, the Crypto.com platform and hold CRO token as part of my cryptocurrency investment strategy.  Page Contents  [] As this is a long review and there is A LOT to unpack here as the platform has a tonne of features, I thought I would provide our readers with a quick summary for those who are pressed for time. Summary: It is a fantastic platform, providing nearly everything a crypto user could want in one convenient, secure, super easy to use app. The team is investing a lot into research and development as well, meaning the platform is just going to keep getting better. Heres what I particularly liked about it: Headquarters: Singapore Year Established: 2016 Product Features: Crypto buy, sell, swap. Fiat deposits/withdrawals. Earn, Supercharger, NFT Marketplace, Crypto card, Exchange, DeFi Wallet, Crypto.com Pay, Crypto Assets Supported: 250+ Platform Token: Cronos (CRO) Security + Safety: High KYC/AML Verification: Yes Fiat Currency Support: AUD, CAD, EUR, GBP, USD, USDC, BRL Deposit/Withdrawal Methods: Credit/Debit CardBank Transfer via SEPA, FPS, ACH, NPP, E-Transfer, Fast Network, SWIFT Regulations and Licenses: Dubai Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority Virtual Financial Asset (VFA) license Electronic Money Institution (EMI) license in Europe Australian Financial Services License Financial Institution License and Class 3 VFA license. Crypto.com is a robust all-in-one home for a multitude of cryptocurrencies and features. 2021 was a huge year for crypto as exchanges such as FTX, Binance, and Crypto.com, seriously upped their game, offering everything under the sun that a crypto trader or hodler could want. Image via Crypto.com There was a time when crypto users would need to spread themselves out over various platforms, you would do your trading on one platform, access earning products on another, use a crypto card on another, invest in a launchpad someplace else, and so on It was a bit of a pain, to be honest. In the early days, it was common to have accounts at 5 or 6 different exchanges and platforms as they all specialized in different areas, but now fortunately, the big exchanges in the space have grown to offer multiple solutions under one roof, simplifying the life of crypto users. Crypto.com is headquartered in Singapore with physical locations around the world. They have over 4,000 employees and boast having the worlds fastest-growing crypto app with over 50 million users buying and selling over 250 cryptocurrencies at true cost. They were the first to launch a metal crypto cashback card which went on to become the worlds most popular crypto card. the platform has a convenient earn section to earn passive income on your hodl stash, an NFT marketplace, a non-custodial wallet with access to DApps, the easiest launchpad type feature that Ive ever used and more which we will cover in detail later. Crypto.coms Vision. Image via Crypto.com Crypto.com is fully regulated and supported in most countries around the world including many US States. Crypto.com became the first global cryptocurrency platform to receive a Class 3 Virtual Financial Assets (VFA) License from Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA), they hold a Financial Institution License, secured an Australian Financial Service License (AFSL), and are FDIC insured, making Crypto.com one of the most regulated and licensed cryptocurrency companies. If you are in the market for a first, or an additional cryptocurrency platform to the one you already use, Crypto.com is definitely one to consider. The company was founded by Bobby Bao, Gary Or, Kris Marszalek, and Rafael Melo in 2016, under the original name Monaco. In the first half of 2017, Monaco launched their own token MCO, which was done through an ICO where the team managed to raise approximately $26 million dollars. The Original Founders are Still on the Executive Team Which is Usually a Good Sign of Confidence. Image via crypto.com In 2018, the company rebranded to Crypto.com after they purchased the domain name for $12 million dollars, then shortly after started shipping the Crypto.com Visa Card which paid users cashback in MCO token. At around the same time, the company announced the launch of the Crypto.com Chain with the native CRO token. There was quite a bit of confusion at the introduction of a second platform token. The MCO token was eventually phased out as the CRO token became the primary driver of the Crypto.com platform, replacing the cashback rewards and other MCO token functions. This whole process caused quite a lot of drama for many upset users in the Crypto.com community, but it was a necessary strategic step if Crypto.com was to create its own blockchain and build out a Crypto.com ecosystem. A Quote from Co-Founder and CEO Kris Marszalek had this to say about the rebrand: Crypto.com gives us a powerful new identity in line with our original vision to put cryptocurrency in every wallet. As the name we are taking on is also representative of the entire space, it comes with a huge responsibility to carry the torch. We will strive to deliver impact worthy of the name and build infrastructure that enables growth of the ecosystem, delivering on the promise of a decentralized future. It was a highly controversial move that outraged a lot of MCO holders. In the interest of keeping this article reasonable length, I wont go into all the details on the drama, the events leading up to and following the switch, the why, and the how, if you want to learn more you can check out this article from Crypto Vantage on the The Crypto.com platform had proven to be so successful that in 2019, they launched their own cryptocurrency exchange to entice more users to the platform. Crypto swaps, buying, and selling can take place on the platform, the exchange platform is geared more towards active crypto traders. The Crypto.com platform and Crypto.com Exchange are separate platforms and apps, which I will touch on a bit more later. Why Crypto Matters According to Crypto.com. Image via Crypto.com Later that year, the company went on a feature launching tangent, releasing Crypto.com Pay, Crypto Earn, Crypto Credit, and offered the massively popular crypto card to the American market. In 2020, the company launched its own non-custodial DeFi wallet and DeFi swap services, while also phasing out the MCO token completely. Fast forward to 2021 and 2022, Crypto.com has made some massive strides in marketing and building out its ecosystem. They are dedicated to becoming a household name for crypto and have spared no expense. Here are a few of their largest marketing plays and Sponsorships: Then, of course, there was the Fortune Favours the Brave advert and campaign which stars Matt Damon, directed by Oscar-winner Wally Pfister that highlights the companys own ethos, while inspiring those who want to change the course of history. Matt Damon had this to say about the campaign: Much like what were doing with Water.org, Crypto.com is a cryptocurrency platform that shares my commitment to empowering people around the globe with the tools needed to take control of their futures. They have built a crypto platform that is accessible and puts people first. Here is a look at the Crypto.com Arena, pretty spiffy looking I must say: If Youre Going to Make a Statement, Make it Big with an Arena! Image via Crypto.com Crypto.com is on a mission to accelerate the worlds transition to cryptocurrency, blockchain, and Web 3, by democratizing blockchain technology and designing beautiful, simple, and useful financial services. Image via The Crypto.Com platform can be used for buying, selling, and swapping crypto, as well as has a convenient fiat on and offramp, making the swap from bank to crypto, and back to bank seamless. The Crypto.com platform is not suitable for day traders as there is little charting functionality and no support for technical indicators. Users will need to use the Crypto.com Exchange platform for those features, which can synchronize easily with the Crypto.com platform making it a nice one-two combo. A Look at the Difference Between the Exchange App and Platform App The platform does allow users to set up things like recurring buys and price targets though, so you dont need to use the additional exchange to snipe good price entries or to set up recurring buys to take advantage of dollar-cost averaging. There are also price alerts that can be set up, so the app has you covered for basic crypto buying and selling. If you are interested in learning more about how to trade and technical analysis, we happen to have an article all about , or if you prefer video format, Guy also has a three-part series on  to help take your trading to the next level. The introduction of the metal cashback crypto cards from Crypto.com was a key pillar that launched Crypto.com into the spotlight and mass adoption. Upon launch, the Crypto.com card was the only metal crypto card available on the market, and offered the highest cash back rewards in the industry, making it instantly the most popular crypto card. Image via Crypto.com Since then, other crypto companies have started releasing highly competitive cards as well, resulting in the Crypto.com card no longer being the only great crypto card on the market. If you are in the market for a crypto card, be sure to check out our article on . Spoiler alert: the Crypto.com card is on the list. Im going to be honest here, the Crypto.com card *was* head and shoulders above the competition until May 2022 when Crypto.com announced they were going to be lowering cashback rewards on the cards, capping monthly reward limits, and cutting staking rewards for the CRO stake needed to access higher card tiers.  This left most Crypto.com users seriously p*ssed off, myself included, I was gutted!  Guy was also affected by this as he is also a Crypto.com card holder and made a video to go over what had changed which covers the event in good detail.  Twitter became an absolute flurry of customer fury, seeing thousands of angry tweets, with some customers going as far as posting videos of themselves lighting their cards on fire, throwing them in the garbage, and breaking them in half. As much as it sucked, it was quite amusing. Images via Twitter Crypto.com customers criticized the company for spending too much on sponsorship deals, resulting in loyal customers being walked on with rewards being cut. Crypto.com did cite that the reasons for reducing rewards were over business model and CRO supply sustainability concerns. After massive amounts of customer backlash, Crypto.com realized they went too far and revised the card rewards, though they still are not nearly as good as they were. Fury aside, the cards are available on a tiered basis. The cashback, staking APY, and other rewards depend on how much CRO token users want to stake, the more you stake, the better the perks. The staked CRO needs to be locked up for 6 months when customers first opt in to the program or if they choose to upgrade. After 6 months, customers can unstake the tokens if they no longer wish to have those tier benefits. The lowest entry card is free but provides 0 perks for anyone who just wants a cool metal crypto card. The free card used to provide 1% cashback which was pretty good for a no-strings-attached metal crypto card. The highest tier gets you 5% cashback in CRO (down from 8%) and to access this card you need to lock and stake an eye-watering 400k USD. Instead of me covering all the perks and benefits, here is a convenient image from their site that sums it all up: Image via Crypto.com To summarize the card, people are furious as they invested a serious amount of money into CRO to receive the amazing perks, only to feel like they were rug pulled as the company backtracked on their offerings which has resulted in the card not being nearly as good as it was, and no longer the best card on the market. Is it still a good card? For sure! Getting a Spotify and Netflix rebate alone is pretty sweet, and the card is amazing for travelling as users can enjoy fee-free ATM withdrawals, free currency exchange transactions, and free interbank exchange rates. Though the perks have been reduced, I still use mine daily as no traditional bank card comes close to being as good, and being able to use the card regardless of what country you are in without worrying about exchange rate penalties and fees is a serious hassle-saver. While the changes were a bit of a kick in the teeth for existing customers, it is still a great choice for newcomers though I can no longer say it is the best card out there. Earning passive APY on crypto has become a staple for many of us in the crypto scene. If I cant stake, lend, farm, or somehow earn something back on my hodl stash, I generally wont bother with the platform. May as well get the best bang for your buck! Crypto.com has a convenient earn section in both the platform and the DeFi wallet, I will cover more about the wallet later. On the platform, users can earn an attractive APY of up to 11% on crypto and up to 10% on stablecoins. A Look at the Earn Section in the Crypto.com App Users can deposit cryptocurrencies and earn interest in over 50 different coins and tokens with more being added all the time. There are three holding terms users can choose from: Here is a look at the rates table as of June 2022 showing the returns that customers can expect: Image via Crypto.com Crypto.com Pay is a payment solution powered by Crypto.org. It is a mobile payment service that lets users pay, or get paid in crypto for free, anywhere, anytime. The feature is run on the Crypto.org Chain, Crypto.coms native blockchain, and provides the following benefits: Here is a look at some of the benefits from the customer and merchant perspective: Image via crypto.com whitepaper At the moment, there are 4 main features of Crypto.com Pay: Supercharger is a fantastic feature on the platform. It is a simple, flexible, and secure rewards feature that allows users to stake tokens with no lock-in restrictions, and earn popular crypto rewards on the Crypto.com Exchange and Crypto.com App. Supercharger works similar to a launchpad, though Supercharger rewards can also be paid out in old school coins like Bitcoin. Supercharger is where users can stake tokens and passively earn reward tokens from projects, ranging from new listings on the platform, start-up projects, , , , you name it. By navigating to the Supercharger section, users will see a charging period for the current event, along with what token is being offered for the event reward. During that time, users can stake and withdraw their tokens in a rewards pool as often as they wish. Then the acceptance period will follow, where users must accept their reward based on the rewards score they accumulated during the Charging Period. Here is a look at a couple of different screenshots showing parts of the process for different events:  After the acceptance period, users will receive daily rewards during the reward period for whatever the token reward was, as is highlighted during the charging period. I really like this feature as it can be done automatically and passively. Users can stake their tokens and select for them to be automatically rolled into the next Supercharger event, allowing the user to sit back and relax while earning multiple different tokens that are simply deposited into their account on a daily basis. It is like playing an airdrop lottery, and once the reward tokens are deposited into a users account, they can swap them for other tokens, stake em, hodl em, or do whatever they want with them. This can be quite lucrative if the event is for some new token that is yet to see wide adoption. You can learn more about this in the Crypto.com help section on . The Crypto.com platform is only available on IOS and Android mobile devices. The company states that for security reasons they do not have a web platform, which has some logic to it as computers are more prone to malware and viruses than mobile devices. The Crypto.com App. Image via The Crypto.com Exchange can be accessed via the mobile application or web browser so traders can perform their technical analysis setups and perform their trading from a larger screen, which makes sense as active day trading from a tiny screen would be a pain. The mobile app is a breeze to use, and it is designed brilliantly. I often find that feature-packed apps that try and do too many things can be difficult to navigate as it can be cluttered and easy to get lost in, but the Crypto.com team did a great job designing the UI/UX with the user in mind, they managed to pack a lot in while still managing to keep the screen free of clutter. There isnt much in the way of needing improvement, that I can say about the app, it really is a powerful crypto powerhouse tool that provides users with just about everything they need to unbank themselves all in one place. The only gripe I have with it is that sometimes it can be slow to start up, taking longer than it should to prompt for a pin/fingerprint and actually start up. A minor inconvenience. Reviews of the app seem to echo my overall positive sentiment with an average rating of 3.8 stars out of 5, I would personally have rated it a bit higher to be honest, but that is just my opinion: Image via Many of the negative reviews are people also mentioning that the app is running slow and being slow to load as I mentioned as well. The lower than deserved rating comes from some unsubstantiated complaints such as there being no way to sell all (there is), complaints about there being no live customer service (there is), a complaint about not being able to swap tokens (you definitely can), and then some legitimate complaints about the app crashing and failing to open on some devices, which I never experienced. Crypto.com NFTs is an NFT platform that aims to deliver unique content from popular artists, musicians, athletes, and sports. Any user can become an NFT creator by minting their own NFTs on the platform and list their collectables for sale in the NFT marketplace. Image via crypto.com The NFT marketplace is very user friendly and allows users to purchase NFTs using a card or Crypto.com Pay. Here is a look at some of the top collectables: Image via Crypto.com NFTs are supported on the Ethereum and Crypto.org chain. Crypto.com has created a new DeFi protocol aptly named  This protocol can currently be interacted with via the Crypto.com wallet browser extension, any wallet supported by WalletConnect, and will soon be integrated with the Crypto.com DeFi wallet. Image via For anyone familiar with , Crypto.coms DeFi Swap will feel very similar. Crypto.com has designed it to be what they state is the best place to swap and farm DeFi coins at the best available rate. Liquidity Providers (LPs) are incentivized for contributing to liquidity pools with Triple Yield through: The five main functions of the protocol are: While buying, selling, swapping, fiat deposits and withdrawals are available within the Crypto.com platform, they also have a separate stand-alone exchange platform that can be accessed via a separate mobile app or web platform. Image via Crypto.com The specifics of the exchange are outside the scope of this article, we will be doing a detailed Crypto.com Exchange review in the near future to cover it in more detail, but in short, the exchange has the following features: To learn more about the Crypto.com Exchange, I recommend checking out their help article on the Crypto.com does not charge any fees for crypto deposits or withdrawals within the Crypto.com ecosystem. Withdrawals to external addresses have fees that vary greatly depending on the token and network. Crypto.com fees can be found on the Crypto Withdrawals page which can be found within the app, which looks something like this:  In order to deposit fiat onto the platform, your best bet is bank transfer as debit/credit card purchases can set you back up to 4%. Bank transfers are free to and from the platform except for USDC, which is awesome, with the following methods being supported depending on your location: For fiat deposits, users can deposit as little as $1 over the SEPA and FPS network for European and UK based customers, while Americans using ACH have a $20 dollar minimum, and a $1,000 dollar minimum for standard wire transfers. The website states that deposits can take a few days, but in my experience using SEPA, deposits happen in seconds. Here are the stated deposit times: For crypto purchases, I did mention there can be up to a 4% charge, a little clarity here would be nice in my opinion. If you are making a big purchase, the difference between 1% and 4% can be quite significant. I also came across this in their fees section which makes me go hmmm. Image via Crypto.com So, it sounds like you are basically playing lucky dip when making a purchase and have no idea what fees you will be paying, and Crypto.com may charge an additional admin fee if they are feeling frisky. I gotta dock them points here as I like clarity in my fee structure, and that isnt too much to ask. After all,  and  both provide very clear and transparent fee structures, meaning you know exactly what to expect. For Crypto.com fees related to the exchange, that information can be found on their  page. Ah, the all-important question of asset support. There is no point in signing up for a platform if they do not support your favourite assets. Crypto.com has an impressive list of over 250+ crypto assets, supporting the majors, and many difficult to find tokens. It is also a great place to pick up some Ripple XRP as many major exchanges have delisted it due to the . Surprisingly, Crypto.com also supports platform tokens and networks for competitors, supporting Binances BNB token and many BEP2 tokens, as well as tokens on the BSC chain (BEP20) which is great to see. I find it a bit petty when exchanges dont list tokens for competitors, as all that is going to do is drive users to the competing platform if they are bullish on that platforms token. For those who like to take full responsibility for their crypto, Crypto.com has created a non-custodial Crypto.com DeFi Wallet so users can seamlessly swap between the platform and the wallet that they hold the private keys for. Image via Crypto.com The Crypto.com Wallet offers the following features: The Crypto.com Wallet is a clean looking, intuitive, secure, and easy to use crypto wallet suitable for all levels of crypto user, though users who need more robust, technical and advanced features may opt for wallets like Electrum or . Image via Crypto.com If you are in the market for a new crypto wallet, we break down the different types in our article on the . The Crypto.com Wallet supports over 100 coins, and tokens can be purchased directly within the wallet for ultimate convenience.  support is big these days as well and the Crypto.com Wallet does not disappoint here. Users can view their NFTs, along with the NFT description, attributes, drop, and creator information. Within the wallet, users also have access to the Cronos Bridge, DApps built on the , Cronos, and Binance Smart Chain through an in-app DApp browser, and WalletConnect. There is also a browser-based wallet extension for use on desktop, similar to . Here is a quick visual showing the advantages and disadvantages of the Crypto.com App vs Wallet. Image via crypto.com whitepaper Users can also access DeFi Swap in the wallet, allowing them to exchange tokens directly in the wallet while accessing coins that can be farmed at the best available rate, leveraging audited farming protocols. DeFi Earn allows users to generate yield on over 35 different tokens which is done by accessing the different DApps that are integrated within the wallet, such as , ,  and more. Image via Crypto.com The Crypto.com Wallet is a pretty underrated crypto wallet in my opinion, and next time we update our article on the Top 8 mobile wallets, it will definitely be making the cut and added there. The fact that the wallet supports NFTs, swapping tokens, seamless earning and farming by conveniently integrated DApps, purchasing crypto, and can access protocols hosted on Ethereum, BSC, Cronos, and Cosmos makes this one of the most multi-functional wallets available. Crypto.com places a strong emphasis on the security of company and user funds, as every cryptocurrency platform should. The team drives a Zero Trust and Defence in Depth security strategy across all their systems and platforms. Data privacy assessments are built directly into the processes that protect user information. Image via Crypto.com The security team screen all deposits for compliance and have a team that manually monitors all transactions on the platform. According to the teams : As far as security features, Crypto.com follows a Secure Software Development Lifecycle, meaning the software undergoes peer reviews and undergoes a combination of static and dynamic source code analysis. Image via Crypto.com Transactions are protected by Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) which includes passwords, biometrics, email, phone, and authenticator validation, and whitelisting of withdrawal addresses is mandatory. For the sticklers who are interested in what certifications and standards are met by Crypto.com, here you go: So, users of the platform can sleep soundly at night knowing that Crypto.com is one of the most secure platforms available. However, in full transparency, the platform did experience a pretty significant hack in early 2022 resulting in lost customer funds. Image via The breach was caused by an issue with failed 2FA authentication integration with the platform. This black eye to their reputation led to Crypto.com adding additional 2FA and multi-factor authentication safeguards to the platform, and beefing up their security protocols. A Crypto.com account can be opened and verified in about ten minutes if everything goes alright with the ID verification step. Accounts are free and very easy to set up, here is the 6-step process on what it looks like to open an account: Pro Tip: Never search for crypto apps directly in an app store due to multiple fake app download links from scammers that are nearly indistinguishable from the real app. Always hit the download link from the company website. Now the unverified account isnt going to let you do much, so you are going to need to go through the KYC verification. To verify your account, you will need the following: If you have got that ready, this is the next 6-step process to verify your account: While Crypto.com was not my first exchange, they were my platform of choice when I decided to get serious and unbank myself, living solely off of crypto. This means that I reached out to their support team A LOT as I was flailing ungracefully, plunging deeper into the world of crypto. At first, Crypto.com support wasnt great, which seems to be a common theme with crypto companies. But after the 2021 bull run, they really ramped up their support services and now I cant really find fault with their support at all. My preferred method of contacting Crypto.com support is through in-app chat functionality, any platform that doesnt support live chat needs to get with the times IMO, email support can be too slow. When using Crypto.com live chat feature, a member of the support team typically gets back to me within 30 minutes to 3 hours. A View of the Live Chat Feature in the Crypto.com App I recently had a bit of a unique case with them that involved collaboration with multiple team members over the span of 4 or 5 days, and they were so professional, friendly, and stayed on the chat with me the entire time, even having to go out of their way a bit to provide me with fantastic service, so a huge shout out to their support team from this crypto guy. Other than live chat, they can also be emailed at contact@crypto.com for questions or queries but live chat seems to be their primary support method. The team is also active and responsive on , and they have a well built out  that should be able to address most questions or issues. There is often some confusion around the Crypto.com ecosystem as they have two chains, Cronos and Crypto.org. You will see this if you go to withdraw CRO on the network, there will be three choices in how you want to withdraw your CRO:  ERC20 is for the Ethereum network. I am assuming you know what Ethereum is, so no need to cover that here, but what about Cronos and CRO? Crypto.com created the Crypto.org chain, and in their words is a Next Generation Public Blockchain. It is a public, open-source and permissionless blockchain that is fully decentralized with high speed and low fees. The mainnet beta is live, and the chain pledges to be carbon negative by 2023. It is being designed to be a public good protocol that will aid in driving mass adoption, supporting use cases like payments, DeFi, and NFTs. Image via Cronos is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible chain running in parallel to the Crypto.org Chain. The settlement currency of the Cronos network is the CRO token, the backbone of the Cronos and Crypto.com ecosystem. The value propositions for the Cronos chain are: Both Crypto.org and Cronos are blockchains that have been built on the Cosmos SDK, which allows them a higher level of interoperability. Cronos is ETH compatible while Crypto.org is a standalone network. Image via crypto.com whitepaper The reason for the two chains is similar to what Binance did with their Binance Chain () and their Binance Smart Chain (BEP20). The primary use for Crypto.org is to allow for fast transactions and very low fees, promoting mass adoption and serving a similar purpose to what the Binance Smart Chain does for the Binance ecosystem. The primary function of Cronos is to allow decentralized applications to be built on the platform using smart contracts. Cronos adopts the CRC20 token standard, similar to how BSC is BEP20 and Ethereum is ERC20. Here is a look at the quickly growing Cronos ecosystem: Image via One thing I really like about Crypto.com is that it is a fully built out, robust ecosystem where crypto traders can do just about everything under the sun without needing to leave the Crypto.com framework. It was very convenient for me when I was earning a salary in cryptocurrency as my employer could send BTC to my Crypto.com account, and from there I could convert it into fiat, or other crypto, stash it away in an Earn account for savings, and of course, spend my salary while earning cashback with the Crypto.com card. It was incredibly convenient and was my first experience truly being able to unbank myself. While the Crypto.com exchange and platform are massively popular, I feel that the wallet and the Cronos and Crypto.org chains are very underutilized and underappreciated in their utility and use cases and unrecognized for their capabilities and innovation. This is something that I feel could see massive adoption and a surge in popularity come the next bull run, and sustainably grow as the industry grows as a whole.  We have seen the titan that the Binance and BSC ecosystems have become, and I feel that Cronos could be seeing similar levels of growth, use, and adoption over time as it looks like Crypto.com are looking to learn from what Binance has created, and as any good competitor does, aim to make it better. Overall, Crypto.com is a great platform, users likely wont be disappointed as it is a very comprehensive, fully encompassing ecosystem where the needs of nearly every crypto user can be met. Crypto.com are one of the major players in the space and is definitely one worth using and watching as they are taking the appropriate steps to build a truly massive ecosystem that aims to propel the entire industry forward while remaining suitable for the little person who just wants a bit of crypto in their lives. Yes, Crypto.com follows industry best practices when it comes to security and regulation. They are highly respected in the industry, used and trusted by millions of users worldwide. They hold some of the highest licenses available in the crypto industry and exceed many industry standards. and Crypto.com fill different roles in the industry. Crypto.com has an entirely built out crypto ecosystem with the Cronos and Crypto.org chain and the native CRO token. Crypto.com is way more than just a place to buy and sell crypto. Coinbases strength is as a basic exchange that is perfect for beginners. Users who want a fully built out, robust crypto ecosystem will likely choose Crypto.com over Coinbase. Crypto.com also has lower fees on average than Coinbase. Users who want a simple, no-frills exchange experience will likely opt for Coinbase if they are okay with the fees. Crypto.com and FTX fill different roles in the industry. Crypto users who want to participate in a full crypto-centric ecosystem that can do everything crypto-related will likely opt for Crypto.com as it has the DeFi Wallet and is Cosmos SDK and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible. is better suited for traders who are looking to actively trade crypto, derivatives, and stocks. Both platforms are incredibly fee friendly and have well built out Earn and NFT sections. FTX does not have its own chain, but heavily utilizes the Ethereum and Solana networks. As Crypto.com is committed to the future of blockchain, they have taken ambitious steps in creating an entire crypto framework and are contributing massively to the entire industry, leaving many investors bullish on the project. Binance did something similar and was handsomely rewarded, becoming the second biggest crypto ecosystem after Ethereum. Crypto.com is building on what Binance has done, aiming to create a more efficient crypto ecosystem to rival the likes of Binance and Ethereum. Users who feel that advancing the crypto industry in this way are bullish on projects that undertake this feat, and many investors feel that Crypto.com is standing on a strong foundation to successfully see their ambitions roll out to fruition. Yes, the Crypto.com app is very intuitive, simple to navigate and easy to use. Crypto.com is dedicated to bringing the next billion people into crypto and understands that user-friendliness is paramount. Ease of use is built into everything they launch.

6,2022-06-01,"Digital Land: Investing in The Metaverse",https://www.coinbureau.com/education/digital-land-investing-metaverse/," As crypto investors, we are often seen as being a few fries short of a Happy Meal from traditional investors and no coiners. We do sit at the brunt of a lot of criticism and scepticism in the investment space, didnt you hear the news? Warren Buffett not only thinks Bitcoin is rat poison, but Remember that Mr. Buffett also passed on Amazon and Microsoft stocks in the early days. The Oracle from Omaha has been wrong about a few things, so I dont let that bother me. Mr. Buffett talks about Bitcoin the way a heartbroken high school kid slanders their ex on social media after a bad breakup. Warren, what did that mean old Bitcoin do to you? Maybe they are right, maybe our elevator doesnt go to the top floor, and perhaps we are the investor equivalent of that guy who tries to eat soup with a fork. Just when they thought we couldnt go any madder as we buy magic rainbow internet money that has no purpose or value, weve raised the crazy bar and are now buying magic imaginary real estate in virtual fairy tale lands. Gif via Tenor If we are crazy, talk about doubling down on our commitment and confidence in digital property. What we are going to explore in this article is digital land and metaverse investing and go over why this concept may not be as crazy as it sounds. Disclaimer: I invest in many of the projects mentioned in this article as part of my personal investment strategy. Nothing in this article is investment advice, metaverse investing is incredibly speculative and high risk. This article is for educational purposes only, do not make investment decisions based on the information presented here.  Page Contents  [] This is a doozy of a question; with no one size fits all answer. Asking what the metaverse is, is akin to asking someone what the internet is. You could ask 100 different people and receive 100 different answers. The one important thing to note is that the metaverse is not just one place, it is a global collaboration, just as the very internet is. If you think about what the internet is, it isnt Google, Facebook, or Amazon, it isnt any single entity like that, it is a global space of information accessible to anyone and contributed to by everyone. The metaverse is evolving to essentially work in a similar fashion and there are already multiple metaverses being built out. Facebook (yeah yeah, now Meta, I know) is building their own metaverse, Sony, Microsoft and Disney are building their own metaverses, and metaverses such as  and  already exist and have a user base. There are literally dozens of metaverses already underway, so it isnt going to be just one place. Image via My personal feeling is that the metaverse is going to be the next evolution or iteration of the internet we already use, a web 3.0 version of the current web 2.0 that the internet is today. The metaverse will work hand in hand, symbiotically alongside web 2. Eventually, the terms metaverse and internet may even be used interchangeably and used synonymously. Much like today, we simply use the term website, a term that hasnt changed for decades even though the underlying technology migrated from pre-HTML, through to HTML 1, HTML 2 all the way to HTML 5, users seldom care as we still just refer to them as websites. The key difference is that instead of accessing the internet with computers and smartphones, we will be fully immersed in these virtual worlds through virtual reality technology. A very simple dumbed down explanation by  sums it up beautifully, stating: I believe that just as you navigate to websites today for different companies and purposes, eventually, we will be navigating to different metaverses instead of websites. Some metaverses will be owned by companies while others will be community-owned and decentralized. These decentralized, community-owned metaverses will be places where companies and users can exist and set up shop as equals, as we have already seen with the likes of  who built the first digital bank in the Decentraland metaverse, and accounting giant Pricewaterhouse Cooper purchased land in the Sandbox metaverse. The Metaverse Will Likely be a Fully Immersive Way to Interact with the Internet. Image via Shutterstock This movement has just started and we are already seeing insurance companies, banks, video game companies, news agencies, advertisement companies and more who are all building within these virtual worlds. To get a firm grasp on what the metaverse and web 3.0 are, as these are massive topics to be explored on their own, we happen to have detailed articles that you should definitely check out. We have a deep dive explaining  and an article on If you are interested in going further down the metaverse rabbit hole, Guy also has a dedicated video on the top virtual land NFT projects: If you believe that the metaverse is the next evolution of the internet, as many do, then it is clear why there is limitless potential. If you asked someone in the early 90s how the internet may impact and shape the future, I doubt anyone would have been able to predict or fathom just how revolutionary the internet would become. The metaverse is likely to eventually encapsulate every company website, and everything we use the internet for today will take place in the metaverse. Gaming, shopping, working, tv and film watching, banking, and countless other things will likely become primarily conducted virtually. If you recall from my article on , an estimated 1/3 of the planets population are considered gamers, a figure that is growing and attracting more people to gaming metaverses. Just as most of us were not aware of our website browsing making the switch from HTML 4 to HTML 5, the 4.95 billion people on the planet who use the internet today, whether they know it or not, will be riding the internet train right into web 3, and potentially, the metaverse. Remember that internet adoption did not happen all at once, it was a trickle of users, that turned into a stream, that turned into a tidal wave, it is probable that metaverse adoption will follow a similar trajectory. Image via If you could go back and own a piece of the internet in the 90s, wouldnt you want to? Many see metaverse investing as a way to actually own a piece of the future infrastructure that will make up a huge part of our daily lives. The opinion that we will be spending the majority of our time in a metaverse is echoed by many such as Microsoft and Facebooks Meta. Metas View of the Metaverse. Image via While a totalitarian metaverse run by Zuckerberg as judge, jury, and executioner, scares the bejesus out of many of us, their  that shows all of us just chilling out and socializing in the metaverse, chatting, playing games, working, and more, I feel is a pretty good portrayal of a metaverse, but how about we use one not controlled by data-hungry, fear-mongering tech giants. Heck, even Mcdonalds, Chipotle and Wendys have launched virtual restaurants in the metaverse, so yeah, its a thing. Gonna Need a Virtual Diet Plan to Work Off These Virtual Calories Image via The metaverse will be accessible by anyone with a simple internet connection. This opens up companies to a potential global customer and client base without the logistical headaches and overhead costs of needing to physically expand your business into other countries. Collaboration will be able to thrive and exist at levels never before possible, creating limitless innovation, the likes of which we cannot even imagine today. Imagine the things that will be possible in a virtual world not restricted by the physical limitations imposed on us in real life. Lets take a look at some fast facts: It is pretty clear as to why there has been billions of dollars flowing into metaverse investment and development as this is likely going to be the place we all hang out in the near future. Think every hour we spend staring at screens now will likely translate directly to time spent in the metaverse. But what is digital real estate specifically, and what makes it so attractive? Metaverse real estate is parcels of land or property that exist in virtual worlds. In their most simple sense, they are pixels of land that make up a broader landscape that can be purchased and owned by connecting a cryptocurrency wallet, and accessed through a device with internet connection. Digital land is more than just digital images as they are programmable. Users can design them how they want and spend time there. Think of it like Minecraft but the key difference being that you actually own your items, can transfer them out of the world, and sell them for real-world monetary value. A Look at the Land Parcels Owned by Users in the Sandbox Metaverse. Image via Sandbox A common misconception about virtual real estate is that you need technical skills to participate which isnt the case for most metaverses. Popular metaverses like Decentraland have an intuitive drag and drop interface where users can create whatever they like with no coding skills required. With the rise of the metaverse, which attracts investor, company, and retail interest, the digital real estate industry is expected to grow. The virtual real estate market experienced a boom in 2021 after Facebook changed its name to Meta and announced its focus on creating a metaverse. As popularity in metaverses grows, virtual real estate is forecasted to have a . You might be asking yourself why anyone would want to invest in digital land, as it does seem a strange concept. After all, you cant build physical property on it, you cant physically live on it, and you might even be thinking it isnt even scarce. The planet earth only has a finite amount of land, which is what makes land valuable in attractive areas. A common criticism against virtual land is that we can create endless virtual worlds with limitless virtual land. We could create so much virtual land that everyone on the planet could have free access to as much land as they want, reducing any value in digital real estate at all. Anyone with any basic economic understanding realizes right away why investing in something with a limitless supply isnt always the best idea. This is one of Bitcoins strongest narratives over fiat currency as there is nothing stopping the Fed from creating new money out of thin air as we have seen in record numbers since the pandemic. Bitcoins finite supply is one of the reasons many people believe that there should be a Bitcoin standard and why Image via The ability to create an endless supply of digital land is a very valid concern, and one of the things that make metaverse investing so risky. A good metaverse investment comes down to the popularity/adoption of a metaverse and something known as network effect. We see how impactful and important network effect is on social media sites with Facebook being a great example. Everyone you talk to seems to hate Facebook and emperor Zuckerberg, yet everyone still uses it. Why? Simple, because everyone else is already there. If all your friends, family and favourite brands are on Facebook, as much as you may hate it, what is the alternative choice? You could go and start up your own, or find an alternative social media site, but if nobody else follows you, its no fun and pretty lonely being the only person using a different social media site. When None of your Friends use MySpace Anymore. Gif via VSGIF.com Metaverse dominance will have the same network effect principles in play. The two largest metaverses in terms of active users today are the Sandbox and Decentraland. Both of these metaverses have a finite supply of land, giving it value. In fact, plots of land in Decentraland have been selling for millions of dollars which is astonishing! Who would have thought that digital land would be selling for more than physical land? Once you dive into it as we will in the next sections, you will see why this isnt as crazy as you initially think. Fashion Street Estate in Decentraland sold for $3.5 Million (618,000 MANA) Image via decentraland.org As mentioned, there is finite land available in metaverses like Decentraland and the Sandbox, and similar to how a plot of land in a place like New York is going to cost considerably more than some backwoods land in the middle of nowhere that nobody wants to visit, these metaverses also have plots of land that cost more as they are in more desirable locations than others. Here is a heatmap showing cost of land in the Sandbox, highlighting that more centrally located plots are more desirable, and therefore, worth more. Image via Snoop Dogg is one of the biggest celebrities who firmly planted a flag in the metaverse. The plot of land beside his mansion in the Sandbox sold for $500k, not because there was anything particularly special about it, other than you get to be neighbours with Snoop Dogg. So, going back to the concern that we can just create another Decentraland or Sandbox, and create more virtual worlds, the network effect is powerful as there is only one Snoop Dogg, and only one tv series: The Walking Dead, and they chose to hang out in the Sandbox. There are already thousands of users in Decentraland, along with Samsung, JP Morgan, Vegas City, and gaming giant  to name a few. So yeah, we can create another world, but I want to hang out in Decentraland, playing Atari. Atari in Decentraland Image via If all your friends are in one metaverse, and gaming giant brands and entertainment companies, along with sporting events and fashion companies that are important to you are in the same metaverse, that network effect reduces the likelihood of newly created metaverses that have none of that devaluing the land owned in an already well-established blue-chip metaverse project. Supply and demand are factors that also play a role in land value within a metaverse ecosystem, but it is ultimately adoption, popularity and network effects (along with useability, of course,) that will give one metaverse value and demand over competing metaverses. These are the main factors that need to be considered when deciding whether or not digital land is a viable investment. Trying to understand why anyone would opt for digital real estate over physical real estate is a hard point to pass across the table to someone who is big on physical assets and traditional investing, and I get it. I am going to take from my own experience here and make a comparison for anyone who is interested in Bitcoin but has not made the leap to understanding the value of digital land yet, as similarities can be drawn by comparing digital land to physical land, as we can compare Bitcoin to physical cash or gold. There are a lot of people in the world whose main financial goal is to own a house with a paid-off mortgage, a sentiment that I agree with, as it is likely the best scenario for most people. Imagine all the extra disposable income you would have if you didnt need to pay rent or a mortgage. Buying a house vs renting is a topic that I have researched at length in the past and is not as black and white for everyone. For example, did you know that in Germany and Switzerland it is more favourable to rent than it is to own? Renting is Preferable to Buying in Germany and Switzerland. Image via Arguments can be made that real estate is a money pit and not always a good investment. In many countries, real estate does not appreciate as well as other assets, and since the 2008 financial crash, real estate has been steadily depreciating in some countries. In many parts of the world, investors would be better off throwing money into an index fund than purchasing a home, but these are topics for another time. Real Estate Investment Profitability is Highly Dependent on Location. Image via For me, I love the idea of having physical real estate, a tangible asset that I can live in and build on, and to know that I always have a roof over my head in case the world goes to hell in a handbasket. I would like to have one physical home for security, not necessarily as an investment, before investing in speculative digital property. Though with that being said, in full transparency for you guys as I dont want to be hypocritical, I actually own digital land and property, but no physical property, which is something I am looking to change. This wasnt entirely my choice, in my article about , I told the story about how I used to earn a salary in Bitcoin, and damn near got laughed out of the bank when I tried to apply for a mortgage. So, I thought screw it, if I cant buy a real home, Im going to buy virtual land and aped into Bloktopia and other projects where I am earning some sweet passive monthly income (more on that later). Image via Availability is a great distinction that separates physical and virtual property. For many of us, getting a mortgage or buying property can be unattainable for multiple reasons. There are far fewer barriers to entry when opting for virtual land, essentially anyone with the internet and the capital can do it. If you can spot good opportunities early, you can get in for a fraction of the cost of physical real estate and the ROI on digital land sales has smashed the physical real estate market out of the park. Some of these plots of land were purchased for mere dollars and later sold for millions, something not seen in the physical realm. If you are on board with Bitcoin, then you likely understand why it is superior to fiat money and gold due to the following principles: You can apply these same principles to digital land vs physical land. Digital land is more durable than physical land Digital land and real estate are not subject to the same hazards as physical property. No need to worry about floods, earthquakes or natural wear and tear, nor do you need to worry about upkeep and maintenance costs. Digital land is more portable than physical land Your virtual real estate can be accessed and utilized from anywhere in the world so long as you have an internet connection. Also, with cross-compatibility with NFTs, if you dont like where your digital house is built, you can pick it up and transplant it somewhere else, even between metaverses someday. Imagine saying you are tired of your apartment in New York, or your neighbourhood has become a rough area, good luck picking up your home with all its furnishings and transplanting it to another country or city. That will be theoretically possible with digital land. You can also sell or transfer your digital real estate nearly instantaneously to anyone located anywhere in the world; borders are a restriction that virtual property does not need to abide by. Digital land is more divisible With , groups of investors can share the cost and get involved with joint ownership of land and real estate far more efficiently and to a greater scalable degree than the traditional real estate industry, without pesky banks and property rights/title deed regulations getting in the way. There is nothing stopping you from drawing a contract up with a group of friends or family and entering a joint venture into digital real estate investing. Plus, with smart contracts, this can all be done in a trustless and permissionless way so you dont need to worry about people backing out of the deal or being shady. Back to the real world, there are rules and regulations in place that stipulate how many names can be on a mortgage, or how many names can be on a property title which can be a burden and a barrier. Blockchain often removes these intermediaries who enforce arbitrary rules, creating a more free and equal system. Digital real estate can have the same principles of scarcity as physical real estate As mentioned, there is a finite supply of land available in some of these metaverses, just as is the case with the real world. While a valid argument is that we can just continually create more virtual worlds, there will still be scarcity driving value if you want prime real estate in prime metaverse locations. Just for fun, here is a chart that shows what factors drive property value from a traditional perspective that we can compare to digital property:    One of the most revolutionary features of the metaverse and digital land is that virtual worlds can be created without the restrictions or restraints that are present in the physical world. Things like gravity, thermodynamics, and physics do not need to be adhered to, meaning that the only limitation is human imagination. Now, admittedly, I am not the most imaginative person on the planet, and I am sure you can come up with more creative and innovative ideas than I can, but what started opening my eyes to the possibilities of the ridiculous beauty that can exist in the metaverse was during the Cardano 2021 virtual summit. The event took place on the back of a giant turtle, surrounded by floating islands which is pretty cool imo. 2021 Cardano Summit. Image via Physical land acquisition has the burdens and hurdles of intermediaries, deeds and titles that need to be transferred, financial party interest, and endless red tape dictating what you can and cannot do with your property. We cant even begin to imagine what the full form of the metaverse will look like with the randomness of a global collaboration of the imaginations without limitations from a global population. Some metaverses will be like something out of a Dr. Seuss picture book times a million. That same imagination can be utilized to figure out the endless ways you can monetize your virtual real estate. You want an underwater M.C. Esher style home complete with friendly dolphins? You can do it, maybe charge a cheeky little entrance fee for visitors. We have already seen virtual concerts from the likes of Post Malone, who rocked out on stage with Pikachu. Ariana Grande, The Weekend, Justin Bieber and Snoop Dogg have also performed in virtual reality venues. Post Malone Performed in a Virtual Concert to Celebrate Pokmons 25th Birthday. Image via If you own a large enough parcel of land, you could be the one to rent it out for these virtual concerts, sports matches, conferences, build virtual movie theatres, arcades, bowling alleys, casinos, you name it! Advertising is also going to be paramount in the metaverse, think about all the advertising that exists on the internet today, that will all need to find a home in the metaverse. If you own land that is likely to see a lot of traffic, advertising and marketing agencies are likely to pay a fortune for the chance to put their brand up at your place. One of the common methods that I have used to earn monthly income from the metaverse is to rent out real estate to companies who want their brand seen in the metaverse. For me, this happens in Bloktopia. This works the same way as renting out office space to tenants in a physical building. My other metaverse income comes from staking and renting out  NFTs to players around the world, so there are a few different ways to capitalize here. As long as you have a piece of land in a metaverse/area that people will want to visit, the sky really is the limit for all the different ways you can monetize it. Or, for a passive approach, many investors are simply flipping digital land as it can often be purchased and then sold later for a profit. This is the million-dollar question that everybody wants to know, isnt it? The truth is, nobody has a crystal ball, and nobody knows which metaverses will succeed and which ones will fail, nor do we even know if virtual real estate is a good investment at all, which is why it is classified as high risk and highly speculative. We could all look back in ten years and go hey, remember when we were all dumb enough to buy virtual land? Then cry into our pile of Beanie Babies and Pogs that we also thought would be worth something someday. How Many People Spent Fortunes on These Thinking They Would Sell for Millions Someday? I Wouldnt Trade a Can of Beans for one Nowadays. Image via Shutterstock When weighing up metaverse investment potential, as with any risky investment, the first thing you should ask yourself is if you have enough disposable money to throw into a metaverse investment. Any money that goes into highly speculative assets like cryptocurrency should be money that you can afford to lose, which is why nearly every financial advisor and honourable crypto personality will tell you that same thing. If I had people in my life who were dependent on my income and I did not own my own home and struggled financially each month, the last thing I would be investing in is metaverse projects. If you do decide to take a crack at metaverse investing, then the traditional methods of valuing real estate should apply to your investment decision. These are things like: Location- Who are the owners of the land in your neighbourhood? Landowners in the Sandbox have raked in masses of income when big brands like Atari, Samsung, and Adidas set up shop next door. Is the location in a desirable area that you will likely be able to sell for a profit later on? Network Effects- Are there enough attractions, brands, and big names in your metaverse to continuously fuel engagement and attract users? Cost Like any investment, there are good times to buy and bad times. Many virtual real estate investors bought in at the peak of the 2021 metaverse mania only to watch the value of their properties drop significantly in value, some as much as 70% or more. Ability to Monetize- The more factors driving traffic to your area will increase your ability to monetize the property and set up additional income streams, or simply increase the value of your investment. How Long You Are Willing to Hold- Many consider metaverse investment as long term with a 5-10+ year outlook. The majority of metaverse real estate sale activity happens in the top two names in the space, Decentraland and Sandbox. These are considered the safest, blue chip metaverse investment plays. Other mentions that are gaining in popularity and growing are the likes of the Solana powered Somnium Space, , Cryptovoxels, , Bloktopia, and the Cardano powered  metaverse, along with many other fantastic looking ones in the pipeline. Image via Sandbox is the leader, dominating approximately 62% of the entire metaverse real estate market. During the 2021 virtual land boom, LAND in the Sandbox was going for an average of $11,000 for a tiny parcel, with higher-end lots going for six figures. Since the hype has died down, Sandbox LAND is now selling for an average price of $3,100. Image via The figures look similar for Decentraland with the average price for a small land plot going for just over $3,000, with some big-ticket estates recently going for $182,000. Not bad considering the initial land offering price was around $20. Being able to turn twenty bucks into six figures is one of the drivers behind metaverse land investing hype for those who are lucky enough to get in early and pick the winners. Image via While the investment may be worth the risk for many, I do think the excitement and hype about the metaverse tends to cloud the logical judgement of many in the space as so many people fomod in. There is also the question of whether or not metaverse interest will ever again reach the euphoria stage seen in 2021, as interest in the entire NFT, crypto and metaverse space has waned in 2022. Search Trends for NFTs and Metaverse are on the Decline. Image via Investing in virtual real estate is much easier than physical real estate and can be done within minutes. All you need to do is: Then of course, once you have your plot of land you can sit and hodl it or build on it until your hearts content.  The metaverse is a very exciting concept as it is something new that we cannot quite grasp the full potential or limitless nature of. But like every new technological revolution and evolution, this type of investment carries high risk. With so much development and building happening in the space as everyone rushes to become part of what could be a multi-trillion-dollar industry, it is almost guaranteed that many projects will not make it, adding another layer of risk to investors. Much like how over 90% of early internet companies have failed, many metaverse and cryptocurrency companies are likely to follow the same fate. For investors able to stomach the risk and volatility, metaverse and digital land investing offers more opportunities for revenue streams, monetization, and higher ROI potential than what is available with physical real estate. It can also be done significantly more efficiently than physical real estate investing, with clicks of a button done in minutes, instead of mountains of paperwork, red tape, and intermediates overcomplicating a process that can take weeks or months. If you are someone whose whole life is spent online, then increasing your virtual presence and investing in metaverse land could be a logical next step. But for many who still want to participate in real life, and do things like raise a family, have friends over for Sunday BBQs, and things like that, spending thousands on virtual property, and needing to spend hours online to manage your digital investments may not be the best call, especially if you do not have a physical and stable property secured for your real-life adventure game. I am a big fan of those post-apocalyptic and zombie-themed TV shows and books, and I do often find myself questioning my asset acquisition in life.

It has been noted that despite bearish prices across the crypto sector, institutional investment and development in the space seems to be unphased by the lacklustre price action, and institutional money is more bullish than ever on the crypto sector. As crypto exchanges , , and  expand operations, and VC firms a16z, Babel Finance, and Huobi Ventures pour billions of dollars into funds that , Tron is the only major network that is showing bullish price behaviour that reflects the behind-the-scenes bullish confidence in the space.

Even the benchmark Bitcoin fell 4.6% while Tron jumped over 11% in a seemingly impossible task. Much of this attention is caused by Trons Terra-style algorithmic stablecoin, USDD, that Tron founder Justin Sun  would be launching at the beginning of May. It would appear that  was not enough to dispel crypto enthusiasts desire for an algorithmic stablecoin, as crypto users flood into Tron to utilize another stablecoin that many feel is nothing but a ticking time bomb waiting to follow Terras fate. It looks as if many investors may have written Tron off too quickly in the previous bull run as TRX has highlighted itself as the clear winner in recent months. While every top ten cryptocurrency aside from stablecoins are down over 10% month-to-date, Tron is up over 30%. Looking at the year-to-date paints a similar picture, BTC is down over 35%, ETH is down over 50%, but TRX has risen 7.5%, a clear outlier across altcoins. Trons increase to $5.99b in TVL gives it the third-largest DeFi ecosystem, with only Ethereum and the BSC network ahead of it.

11,2022-05-30,"The 8 Best Desktop Wallets in 2022",https://www.coinbureau.com/review/best-crypto-desktop-wallets/," Believe it or not, there are still many out there not spooked by recent market conditions and are doubling down on their efforts, including me. I look at these prices and think: yay, Black Friday sale! After all, the foundation for fortunes comes from bearish times, with the riches reaped during bullish periods. Having bought a bunch of tokens, the next thing to do is hunt for a good wallet to store them in. When it comes to wallet types, there are primarily two types: cold and hot wallets. The former refers to hardware wallets that come in the form of a USB stick and a desktop application as the UI for it. The latter are divided into mobile wallets, browser-extension/web wallets, and desktop wallets. In this article, we are going to focus on the last kind.  Page Contents  [] The easiest way to think about desktop wallets is that they are wallet apps designed for computers. Technically- speaking, there are no mobile versions, so users cant easily access it across multiple devices. However, some wallet developers want to offer users the option of a mobile app if they so desire. My suggestion is that if you choose the desktop version, ignore the mobile app. As inconvenient as it may seem, its also more secure because theres only one way to access it. I would swap convenience for security any day when safeguarding my precious crypto assets. There are a few things to consider when looking to get a desktop wallet. Some of these considerations are based on your purpose for getting the wallet in the first place. Some wallets only support one type of crypto, mainly Bitcoin or Ethereum. Other wallets support every token traded on major exchanges. Unfortunately, this usually doesnt include newer tokens that only get listed in DEXs. When I first came across, I didnt realise until later that its an example of afull nodewallet. Whenever I boot it up to check on my ADA holdings, its downloading a copy of the Cardano blockchain onto my laptop. Unfortunately, the bigger the blockchain got, the longer it took to access the wallet on my poor laptop. Unless you are looking to run a full blockchain node yourself, I would say that a full node wallet isnt something suited for everyone. For example, most of us use our wallets to transfer funds or do some staking. In this case, theSimple Payment Verificationtype would be sufficient to suit our needs. Most wallets in the market are of this type. It verifies that a transaction is in the blockchain without downloading the entire blockchain. Its standard to assume that any desktop wallet worth its salt should at least have seed phrase protection. You are also given a recovery phrase to access your wallet if your computer is stolen or destroyed. Going one step up would be 2FA. Short for Two-Factor Authentication, the two-factor part refers to what you know and what you have. A password is an example of the former, and an Authenticator app like Google Authenticator or Authy is the latter. The app generates a 6-digit code entered in the wallets interface as proof of having something. Some wallets even come with themultisigoption. Short for multi-signature, its not enough for one person to sign a transaction independently. Instead, the number of people established initially all need to sign the transaction to show complete agreeance for the transaction to go through. That way, even if one person is compromised, the funds still cant be moved. As long as something is online, getting hacked is always possible, even if that possibility might be quite low. If the desktop wallet is connected with a hardware wallet, this greatly decreases the risk of stolen funds since it still boils down to what you have. In this case, funds transfer needs to be approved with the USB device that is the cold wallet. Hackers from afar would be unable to get their hands on this device.  Check that the funds you want to protect are in the account or wallet address connected to the hardware wallet. For example, with browser-extension wallets, the connected account is not necessarily the default account, so you will need to transfer funds to the correct account. No matter how secure the desktop wallet is, if the UI is poorly-designed, its not going to have many people using it, which defeats the purpose of its existence in the first place. It needs to have a certain level of intuition that most people can grasp without resorting to watching how-to-use videos on YouTube. When things go wrong, as they sometimes will, reaching out to someone who can look into your problem is a great relief. One of the most common reasons for wanting to talk to customer support is when funds dont show up as expected, especially if you can see that it was a successful transfer on the blockchain explorer. Email support would be the bare minimum. Chat support would be better but dont hold your hopes up for phone support. Unless there is a financial entity behind the wallet, who will pay for the staff to chat with you? Aside from providing a safe space for you to store your funds and allowing you to send and receive funds, some wallets also have other functions like crypto-trading or staking. These wallets integrate with a trading platform so that you can trade while still retaining custody of your funds. Theres also no need to trade on a decentralised exchange which entails going to a different website. However, this is not the cheapest option. I guess thats the price for both convenience and security. Nothing is perfect and expecting anything like that is just an invitation to disappointment. Here are some of the things to watch out for when using desktop wallets: Now that we have covered most of the bases lets get cracking looking at whats available to choose from in the marketplace! Before Satoshi, there was. Or so they would like to claim. In reality, the first  was launched in August 2014., the same year Mt Gox went kaput. Having been around the block, it is one of two top hardware wallets in the industry. Sorry if I have to cheat a bit here by including it in this article, but it has a desktop interface and doesnt come with a mobile version, so lets just let that slide, shall we? The wallet comes with what looks like a fancy car key as the hardware component. This is paired with the desktop app for managing the assets supported by the wallet. The interface is relatively clean and straightforward and supports pretty much any token under the sun. One of the leading industry standards for wallets. Image via Trezor Aside from retail owners, Trezor is also used by many significant enterprises and endorsed by Coindesk, Forbes etc. If these companies trust Trezor to do their job, there is no reason for you and me not to. Trezors no. 1 competitor is, and Im sure the feeling is mutual between them. The company started in 2014, the same year as Trezor and is based in Paris, France. The desktop app, known as Ledger Live, is the interface for their hardware wallet, of which there are three models. Through the app, you can stake, swap assets and even manage your NFTs directly. Unlike Trezor, which needs to rely on a third-party intermediary like Metamask to manage NFTs, you can send, receive and see your NFTs in the Ledger Live app. However, only Ethereum and Polygon-based NFTs are supported currently. Another function in the wallet is that you can buy bitcoin directly in  through their partnership with Coinify and Wyre via credit/debit card. One of the things that always makes me antsy about buying bitcoin is the time it takes to transfer it from wherever to the Ledger wallet (Disclaimer: I own a Ledger wallet). So being able to go from buying to storing in a cold wallet in one shot is as safe as it goes for making a crypto purchase. However, the rates arent always the best as its pretty much a spot purchase, i.e. buying based on market rate and the fees are also something to consider. Robust security and an easy-to-understand interface. Image via Ledger In my early days of getting my feet wet in crypto, that was when I heard about. At the time, I thought all it had was the mobile version. Only much later did I find out that they have a desktop version. Unlike other wallets that simply list Linux as one of the supporting operating systems, they listed specific Linux distro packages such as Fedora, Ubuntu and Debian. That tells you how serious they are when it comes to the business of desktop wallets. Its also a prime example of a wallet providing more than just the basics. Aside from supporting a variety of tokens, they allow users to buy crypto with a regular credit card with a 1% cashback. After purchasing the tokens, you can also earn some juicy staking rewards directly in the wallet. Please note that they only support 13 tokens for staking currently, so check first before you buy if this is what youre interested in. The most unique feature about Atomic that is not found with the other wallets (yet?) is their native token AWC. With a current price of$0.535, it is a BEP-20 token. Earn up to 20% staking the token with Atomic and get 1% cashback for exchanging tokens in the app. Theres even a hint of a referral program coming soon! Theres not as much talk about their security features as some of the wallets do, so while Im sure its as safe as they can make it to be, Id likely only store enough crypto in it as a way of diversification, but that I wont lose sleep over if anything were to happen. A multi-asset wallet that does more than just store tokens. Image via Medium.com/Thorchain One of the most well-known bitcoin wallets, Electrum is a multi-sig wallet with cold storage capability for storing your precious bitcoin. Although it also has a mobile version, were just going to focus on the desktop version for our current purposes. They partner with TrustedCoin in providing the 2FA service. How the multi-sig wallet works is that it has three keys. The user owns two of the three keys, and the third key is in a remote server. A small fee is charged for every transaction using that server. Featuring a no-frills UI and integration with Trezor and Ledger for additional security, this is a basic wallet for all things Bitcoin, including the. When setting up the wallet, you can choose from a series of options. As basic as it comes but gets the job done. Image via Electrum app One of the most popular wallets around, I know quite a number of people who swear by . Its also a top wallet recommended by many in the know, including Investopedia, for beginner users, according to their website. The wallet comes with both a desktop and mobile option but feel free to ignore the latter if you choose the former. Its also integrated with Trezor to provide an extra layer of security. What struck me about the wallet is that it makes full use of the space allocated for a desktop app. Aside from showing the portfolio with key numbers, you can also see the chart for a chosen asset and other useful information. While there is quite a bit of info packed into it, the layout is still pleasing to the eye and, more importantly, not overwhelming. 200+ assets in a colorful yet elegant interface. Image via Exodus Not content with being just a multi-asset wallet supporting more than 200 assets, Exodus also features an exchange within the wallet, allowing for easy swaps between assets without any additional sign-in or navigating to other pages. This is an integration with, giving you access to the exchanges features without signing up for an account with them. Another partnership that benefits users is withby allowing them to earn yield from the DAI in their wallet. Sports-betting is also possible with Exodus, and not just for regular sports such as baseball, basketball etc., but also for E-sports like League of Legends. In the meantime, other apps are in development and will no doubt be unveiled when they are ready. A key selling point of the wallet to newbies is its 24/7 human support. They also have an extensive Knowledge Base section that includes a section on blockchain education so users can learn a bit more about the assets they have. If I were a newbie, I would consider using Exodus.  Every now and then, Id come across certain things that seemed to pop up repeatedly. Thewallet is one of those. Its a wallet under most peoples radar, yet the reviews are mostly positive, as seen on this page from. The wallet is aimed at the mainstream crowd with the following features: The website also features quite a sizeable section on crypto education where one can learn about crypto basics, written in pedestrian language, i.e. language that most people understand. This messaging is consistent with their approach of being the wallet for the everyday Joe. Customers can talk to someone via Live Chat to answer any questions or concerns they may have. At the same time, email support is available during the after-hours period. A wallet for the everyday Joe  Image via Guarda One of the things you might notice as you browse the homepage foris its claim to being the oldest multi-asset wallet. It was established in 2014, which in most cases, being less than a decade old, doesnt seem much, but in crypto-land, where six months is equivalent to 1.2 years in normal speed, that does seem shy of being next to the dinosaurs. It also makes it impressive and maybe suitable for the casual crypto user because it supports a wide range of fiat currencies in more than 20 languages. With versions available for Windows, Mac and Linux, it is one of the wallets on this list that has a decent social presence, with communication channels on Facebook, Twitter, Telegram, Reddit and Instagram, pretty much covering all the major age and gender groups, with TikTok being the only channel they dont have a presence. Additionally, they offer 24/7 live support, undoubtedly music to a beginners ears, as they can expect some handholding when exploring the wallets features. They also feature YouTube tutorials if you prefer to learn by watching than reading. All the reasons to use Coinomi listed in colorful headings. Image via Coinomi Some interesting features of the wallet include: Nice UI to attract some eyeballs. Image via Coinomi Thewallet is another single-asset desktop wallet for storing Bitcoin with cold storage and multi-sig support. They pioneered managing Bitcoin offline with a computer that never touches the internet. Instead, transactions are made with a watching-only wallet, but the private keys themselves are stored in the offline computer. This greatly reduces the attack surface for hackers. The source code for the wallet is open-source and available for audit and views on GitHub. So in the unlikely event the entity behind it goes under, it is still possible to access your funds with a bit of know-how. The website also has a tutorial section on using the wallet for various functions. As it was designed for developers to use, the UI is very basic. But enough to do what needs to be done. When it comes to security, though, its pretty top-of-the-line. Given the opportunity, I wouldnt mind storing my bitcoin in this wallet. For a free wallet, its as good as it gets. A free wallet with top-notch security for your bitcoin. Image via Armory Weve covered some of the more well-known ones available in the market. It is by no means an extensive list but to give you an idea of what is considered standard functionality and what is a unique selling point. Most importantly, its about finding a wallet that fits your needs, and its ok if no single wallet fulfils all of them. In fact, it might not be a bad idea to diversify a bit by having two or even three wallets for your crypto. That way, if anything bad were to happen to one of them, youd still have your assets safe in other wallets. Just dont spread yourself too thin that you cant manage what you own.",coinbureau,coinbureau,Positive,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1

In a recent  with Coindesk, Hoskinson pointed out why we need to be more careful stating: If you move too quickly, as weve seen with Luna, and weve seen withlast year, you could actually get it to work until it doesnt, and then when it doesnt its a catastrophic failure and everybody loses their money In contrast, Hoskinson said that he and his company IOG (formerly IOHK) are moving deliberately in building the Cardano network playing the long arc game, measured not in weeks or months, but in years to decades. We always say its not first, its best out of the gate who succeeds, Hoskinson said. The people who are going to survive are those who are tested under stress and exhibit resiliency. Hoskinsons Cardano project is one of the most closely watched in the industry, amassing vast amounts of attention from retail and institutional investors alike partly thanks to Grayscales Smart Contract Platform Fund.

13,2022-05-30,"Bitcoin and Stocks: Not the Decoupling We Were Hoping For",https://www.coinbureau.com/news/bitcoin-and-stocks-not-the-decoupling-we-were-hoping-for/," Bitcoin has been showing a strong relationship to the stock market in recent months, with a notably strong correlation in performance with the Nasdaq. But last weeks market data suggests that this correlation is weakening and could be coming to an end. For a long time, crypto enthusiasts have been keen to see a decoupling in the relationship between Bitcoin and traditional financial markets so Bitcoin can live up to its potential narrative of being an , , and a useful asset to hold as part of a . Bitcoins performance in recent months has gone hand in hand with the greater stock market, reducing its effectiveness in the mentioned narratives. When stocks are up, BTC price has gone up, and when stocks drop, Bitcoin typically follows suit. A Look at Bitcoin vs the Nasdaq composite index. Image via This past week saw green action across the stock markets, with the Nasdaq up 3.1%, while Bitcoin has fallen 3%, not exactly the sort of decoupling we have been hoping for. The United States Commerce Department released  on May 27th, showing that personal savings rates fell to 4.4% in April, reaching the lowest levels since 2008. This has sparked fear among investors and crypto traders that worsening global macroeconomic conditions could lead to further aversion for capital allocation to risk-on assets, which is how Bitcoin is viewed by many institutional investors. One of Bitcoins strongest narratives that we are yet to see play out is as a viable risk-off asset class, a store of value similar to the likes of Gold that could lead to further inflows of institutional money into the asset. A further decoupling could help drive this narrative to fruition. As institutional investors have been cautiously dipping their toes into the Bitcoin pool, the asset has been largely treated as a risk-on asset, along with tech and speculative growth stocks, which has led to Bitcoin seeing similar buying and selling patterns. Bitcoin holders often argue against the asset being treated as a similar speculative gamble and feel that institutions are failing to see Bitcoins true potential. While one week of data is not enough to make any definite conclusions, this new inverse correlation is interesting to see. It appears that for the past week, for better or for worse, Wall Street agreed with the sentiment that Bitcoin should not be placed in the same basket as other assets.

In  for a testimony to the Committee on Financial Services in Washington, Brainard alluded to the recent  (UST) debacle that wiped out over $50 billion in wealth, and used it as an example of why comprehensive regulation should exist for stablecoins. There has been explosive growth in an emergent digital financial system built around new digital assets and facilitated by crypto-asset platforms and stablecoins as settlement assets, she said. Two widely used stablecoins have come under considerable pressure. One widely used algorithmic stablecoin declined to a small fraction of its purported value, and the stablecoin that is the most traded crypto asset by volume temporarily dipped below its purported one-to-one valuation with the dollar. Image via Shutterstock According to Brainard, these events highlight the need for clear regulator guardrails to provide consumer and investor protection, protect financial stability, and ensure a level playing field for competition and innovation across the financial system. The Fed official said that currently, there may not be an immediate need for a , but that in the future, there could be conditions that may give rise to such a need. We recognize there are risks of not acting, just as there are risks of acting. Brainard suggested that if stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies  what she refers to as private monies  rise to prominence and become widespread, there may be a fragmentation of the US payment system into so-called walled gardens. If and when private money does rise to prominence, Brainard hinted that it could coexist with CBDCs, and the two asset classes could ultimately complement each other.

The Chamber of Digital Commerce is an American crypto advocacy group and one of the leading trade associations representing the digital asset industry. Its very clear that the US Securities and Exchange Commission is the number one blocker to this industry having economic progress and springing an economic boom in this country that we havent seen in decades, founder Perianne Boring said at the Blockchain Summit in Washington, according to a  from Blockworks. Boring said that the SEC needs to define what a digital asset security is and that the industry cant go on without any clear guidelines. At the time of Borings comments, the SEC still hasnt approved a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (), only approving several futures-based products which much of the industry isnt exactly impressed with given their voodoo-like formula for pricing and its tendency to suck capital away from BTC. How do we have futures ETFs but not a spot ETF? Boring said. It doesnt make sense, and its often harming investors in an incredible way.

The report, titled Decrypting financial stability risks in crypto-asset markets, while mostly a critique and warning of the industry, does reveal some bullish metrics. For example, the ECB says that based on results from its recent Consumer Expectation Survey (CES) from six larger eurozone countries, as much as 10% of households may own crypto-assets Most crypto-asset owners reported holding less than 5,000 in crypto-assets, with a slight predominance of smaller holdings (below 1,000) in this group, they said. At the other end of the spectrum, around 6% of crypto-asset owners confirmed that they held more than 30,000 in crypto-assets. Looking at the income quintiles of the respondents, the pattern is largely U-shaped: the higher a households income, the more likely it is to hold crypto-assets, with lower-income households more likely to hold crypto than middle-income households.

It also found that respondents were either at the top level of financial literacy or at the bottom, similar to the U-shape found in their income disparities. On the other hand, the ECB says: Crypto-assets lack intrinsic economic value or reference assets, while their frequent use as an instrument of speculation, their high volatility and energy consumption, and their use in financing illicit activities make crypto-assets highly risky instruments. This also raises concerns over money laundering, market integrity and consumer protection, and may have implications for financial stability. The government body reiterated that crypto assets are not suitable for most retail investors, either as an investment or store of value, warning that they could lose a large amount of the money they have invested. The ECB also listed all the usual alleged risks associated with crypto, including misleading information, the absence of rights and protections such as complaints procedures or recourse mechanisms, and product complexity with leverage sometimes embedded.

Speaking in an interview with Bloomberg Technology, Gupta said she thought it was just the beginning of a crypto winter to be very honest and was surprised at how many people believed Bitcoin would hold support at $30,000. I do expect it to go down to somewhere between $14k, $18k, maybe $22k as a stable point but remember we have seen this the past two times. This is nothing new right, every time it goes up to an all-time high there is a point when it comes down to and finds the new lower point as a base point to stand around. I still feel that we have already entered crypto winter and were gonna stay here for at least a year to a year and a half. Gupta, who started the Delta Fund in 2021 after receiving $50 million in commitments,  that she isnt expecting  to get back above $45,000 for another year or so.

I dont know about you, but I grew up on anime and online TCGs. I spent countless hours grinding in Yugioh Duel Links and Hearthstone. And when I got into crypto and blockchain gaming, a couple of the very first games I discovered were Splinterlands and Gods Unchained. With  getting , I decided now would be the best time to write a piece on Splinterlands, one of the most popular TCG games thats successfully survived more than four years in the crypto gaming industry. Bear or Bull Market, this game has managed to hold on. In this article, I try to give you a good idea of what the game is, how to get started, and whether you can make a profitable side hustle from playing competitively. So, without further ado, let us get down to the details. Page Contents  [] Splinterlands is a multiplayer digital-collectible trading card game on the Hive blockchain. The game is a strategic auto-battler, where players must put together the most optimal 7-card deck to fight against their opponents in each round. Each round will begin with its own set of rules upon which the player must create their deck. Its reminiscent of games such as Hearthstone, Legends of Runeterra, Yu-Gi-Oh and Magic the Gathering Arena.  Cards in Splinterlands are player-owned non-fungible tokens. Players can use their NFTs to battle for prizes, collect them as collectibles, trade them on the peer-to-peer market, combine them to level up, or even burn them to get Dark Energy Crystals, Splinterlands official in-game cryptocurrency. Splinterlands follows a play-to-earn model with players winning rewards in the Ranked mode by competing against each other in a league-based system. To progress up the league, players must secure wins and earn rank points. The higher the league, the better rewards players can earn through winning matches. Splinterlands is free-to-try but not free-to-play. Players cannot earn rewards or buy card packs to competitively climb ranks without purchasing the Summoners Spellbook (more on that later). However, the game does allow players to play a few matches and try it for free before deciding to invest in the game. The game was originally launched on the Steem blockchain as Steem Monsters in May 2018 before rebranding to Splinterlands in April 2019. Splinterlands officially migrated to the  after it forked from Steem in 2020. Steem Monsters Banner via Splinterlands was developed by  and , who took inspiration from popular card games such as Magic the Gathering and Hearthstone. The two met in 2018 and were working together to build a marketing platform when they learned they had a common interest in gaming. When Matthew suggested that they start a trading card game, Dr. Reich revealed that he had one almost ready to go. This was the beginning of the game which would be known today as Splinterlands. Splinterlands Team Community Call via Since that April 2018 meeting, the game has been played tens of millions of times, the cards are collectively worth millions of dollars, and players are actively trading with each other on the marketplace. The game has truly become one of the most popular crypto games in the industry. The team behind the game has also expanded manyfold since then, with over  and many collaborators. Currently, Dr Reich handles fundraising, sales, marketing, financials, game development, and community development of Splinterlands while Matthew is the CTO of the project. The team also boasts of high-profile advisors with a rich experience in the field. The projects senior advisor  is a consultant with the United Nations for almost 4 years. He primarily aids the UN with FinTech & Blockchain solutions to help alleviate poverty, support business ecosystems, and improve society at large. Another advisor, Edward Sullivan is currently the CEO and Founder of Trust Exchange. To get started with playing Splinterlands, the first thing you need to do is create an account by signing up. You can do so by going to  or by downloading the app and signing up with your smartphone. You can play Splinterlands on both the browser and mobile device. For mobile, Splinterlands is available on both Android and iOS. Splinterlands Welcome Page After successfully registering, the game will provide you with a basic set of starter cards that are not NFTs. You can use this deck to take the optional tutorial and learn the different mechanics of the game while playing a few practice matches. Now that youve played a few practice matches, you probably want to try climbing up the ranks with your free non-NFT starter deck. Well, I hate to break it to you, but you cant. Well, technically, you can try and maybe win a few matches. But it is virtually impossible to rank up without buying or renting a few cards. And, to be able to buy or rent cards, you need to purchase the Summoners Spellbook from the game. Summoners Spellbook Payment Page Dont worry, its not an actual spellbook but rather a sort of membership pass. Purchasing the spellbook primarily creates an account on the Hive blockchain for you. This way all the NFTs and tokens you accumulate can be safely stored in the wallet. The Summoners Spellbook is a one-time purchase and costs $10. Payment can be made through two channels- either crypto or PayPal. Once youve made this purchase, all of the features of the game such as purchasing cards and using some in-game features will be made available. Starting from May 31st 2022, purchases of Summoners Spellbook will include 3000 Credits which can be used in the in-game shop or to purchase or rent cards from the market. Players can now Now that weve understood how to setup the game, let us take a brief overview into all the components of the game before delving into the gameplay. The cards are the primary component of the game. They can be acquired by purchasing booster packs or by receiving rewards in loot chests at the end of the season. They are also actively traded on Splinterlands own marketplace as well as secondary markets like  (Hive chain) and  (Wax blockchain). Cards can be broadly categorised into three types: summoners, monsters and item & spell cards. Currently, Summoners and Monsters are the primary cards used to play the game. Splinterlands Fire Splint Cards via Each Summoner and monster corresponds to one of seven splinters. Splinters are like elemental factions to which each card belongs. The splinters currently in existence are fire, water, earth, life, death, dragon, and neutral splinters. During the game when a Summoner is chosen, the player will only be able to make a deck with monsters that belong to the same splinter as the summoner. The only two exceptions to this rule are monsters belonging to the neutral splinter and summoners belonging to the dragon splinter. Neutral monsters can be included in any splinter deck. Dragon summoners allow you to use dragon monsters as well as monsters from one other splinter. This could be dragon+fire, or dragon+water, or dragon+any of the other splinters available. Item and Spells Splinterlands Banner via Item and Spell cards are an upcoming feature that will be released with the lands of the Splinterlands game. These cards will not be sold by Splinterlands but instead mined from the land parcels and sold in the secondary markets. Item and Spell cards allow the player to actively influence the outcome of the match by letting the player use the card during the match. This disrupts the current auto battler format of Splinterlands. There are five primary stats on a card- The cards themselves have two different types of rarities. Gold Foil Card via Foil rarity Both summoners and monsters can be regular, or of a gold foil variation. Gold foils are rarer than regular foils, and provide more Collection Power than a regular card. Each gold card also gives a 10% bonus when played in a winning battle. Supply rarity This rarity refers to the number of copies of a particular card in circulation and is split into common, rare, epic and legendary based on the opening percentage in booster packs or Loot chests. The higher the rarity, the more copies of the card are required to level the card up. Cards can be levelled up by combining multiple copies of the same card. Higher-level cards get increased statistics and, often, additional abilities. Cards can use these abilities to trigger a special effect or increase the stats of your own cards or decrease the stats of your opponents cards. A  available in the game can be found on the official Splinterlands website. Splinterlands has an  as well as multiple secondary marketplaces such as ,  and . Players can buy, sell and bid on the built-in marketplace. The marketplace offers easy filtering options so that players can sort through and find the card most suited to their needs. Each card listed on the marketplace has additional information such as the number of cards in circulation as well as the lowest price for that particular card in the market. Rental Market Splinterlands Players can also rent cards rather than buy them via the built-in marketplace. This is possible due to Hive blockchains delegation feature that allows assets to be delegated to other accounts on the blockchain. The rental cards, however, have limitations. For example, they cant be combined, sold, or transferred, but the renter can utilise them in play, and they add to the players total CP. Land in Splinterlands offers owners the ability to mint exclusive items and spell cards. As explained before, these items and spell cards will never be sold by the team but instead produced and traded completely between players. Splinterlands Land on AtomicHub The land sales happened in batches over 2020 and 2021 and have completely sold out. Soon after the primary sales, the gameon the secondary market for over $700,000. Currently, you can purchase land on secondary markets, with the cheapest one selling for around $250 aton the Wax blockchain. Splinterlands also has a guild system where players can band together and use their combined resources to earn additional value, including DEC bonuses and discounts on various Splinterlands purchases. Guilds can be extremely useful to maximise the rewards obtained from the game. Guild members can commit DEC and grow the guild to unlock various benefits for members. In future updates, we can also expect to see brawls between guilds. Brawls are a guild vs guild battle format where members belonging to two different guilds are pitted against each other to earn merits and crowns which are used to upgrade buildings and buy gladiator packs. Now that weve touched upon all the components that make up Splinterlands, lets look at the gameplay, shall we? There are three main battle modes in the game: To earn rewards, players need to competitively battle each other and win in the games ranked mode. Once players have chosen to battle, the game matches the player with another player of the same or similar skill level. This ensures that matchups are fair and equal.  Once the matchup is decided, the screen prompts both players to create a deck of 7 cards comprising one summoner and six monster cards arranged in the sequence of play. Again, strategy and card collecting play a very important role here, as battles in Splinterlands implement an element of randomisation by changing the rules for every battle. In lower leagues, the change in rules typically involves changing the amount of mana provided to players in every battle. Every card has a mana cost that must be paid to place it within a deck. The changing mana limit ensures that players do not repeat or spam the same decks or strategies for every match in the game. Deck Building Phase with 32 Mana Restriction In higher leagues, the change in rules typically involves a mana restriction and disallowing specific summoners, cards or abilities. This added complexity provides a better challenge to the more skilled players of the game. This ensures that the gameplay remains interesting and stimulating while preventing a meta saturation during the season. For the non-gamers, meta in gaming terminology generally refers to the most powerful strategy or card combination currently trending within the TCG game. Players with a broader collection of cards would be able to navigate battles better despite the mana limit or other restrictions in the game. In addition, having a wider variety of cards at hand gives the player more choices in creating a deck, underlining the importance of card collecting within the game. Strategic Gameplay Splinterlands However, just having a wide variety of cards is not enough. Players also need to be strategic due to Splinterlands auto-battler format. This format does not allow players to actively influence the direction of the battle once the deck is made and the battle has begun. Instead, the order of play in which the cards were arranged in the deck and the distribution of stats play a key role, underlining the importance of strategy. Once the decks have been made and confirmed by both players, the battle results are immediately uploaded to the blockchain and players are displayed a live replay of the battle. Though you can skip the replay, I highly recommend watching it as it allows you to learn different strategies and combinations used by your opponents. Splinterlands follows a league-based system for its ranked battles, with six leagues that players can be placed in according to their rating points and Collection Power (CP). As players progress through the Leagues, the rewards increase, but so does the complexity of strategy and the intensity of competition. When a player qualifies for the next League, they have the option to advance or stay in the current League. If they remain in the same League, gaining points will be more difficult because nearly everyone they encounter will have lower League scores than them, but they will be able to compete for the top spot in their current League. The top players on each Leagues leaderboard are awarded booster packs as prizes, apart from their rewards at the end of each season. The six leagues are:  Silver and Gold Leagues Diamond and Champion Leagues The seasons in Splinterlands follow a similar pattern in other online TCG games. Splinterlands seasons range between 12 to 16 days, with the end time of each season being rotated so that players from different regions of the world get to experience that last-minute grind to the leaderboard.  Season Countdown At the end of each season, players are awarded the corresponding Loot Chests to their final league ranking. After the loot chests are given out, the booster packs are distributed to the top 50 leaders in each league. However, be mindful that players need to participate in at least one match to be eligible for season rewards. After all the rewards are distributed, the timer is reset for the next season, and the player is dropped by one league. For players to progress along the leagues, they need to be mindful of two key rating metrics. The first is the players Collection Power (CP), and the second is the players rating points. Collection power is the combined Dark Energy Crystals (DEC  the main in-game currency of the game) burn value of each NFT card owned or leased to you that is in your possession. This excludes the non-NFT starter cards that every player receives when creating an account in the game. So what does that mean? When cards in Splinterlands are burned, they produce a certain amount of DEC received by the player burning the card. The total number of DEC you would receive if you were to burn all the cards in your possession would be your Collection Power. Splinterlands: Chaos Legion Each League has a threshold CP that players need to cross to rank up. This means that you cant rank up unless you own or rent a good number of cards. Players can acquire cards in two ways- either by purchasing individual cards or booster packs in the primary or secondary markets or by renting cards from other players in the markets. The second metric for ranking up is the actual player rating, which players gain through winning games. Each League and its tiers demand a steady increase of 300 rating points per tier to move on to the next one. The only exception to this rule is the Champion league which requires an increase of 500 rating points to move to the next tier. However, gaining rating points isnt easy; every match you lose reduces your rating points. So ideally, players must have at least a consistent 50% win rate to progress smoothly in the leagues. The Splinterlands team hasthat will go into effect from 31st May 2022. The new rewards system will significantly bump up the number of rewards issued to players by incentivising players to play the game and rack up more wins. Ranked Rewards Under the new model, season rewards will be based on the number of reward shares earned from all ranked battle wins during the season. Earlier, only the DEC rewards were influenced by the rewards share system, but now the system will extend to seasonal and daily rewards. Additionally, this means that the bonuses from gold foils and guilds can now be applied to seasonal and daily rewards. There will also be different loot chests, one corresponding to each league (Bronze  Champion), with higher league chests containing significantly more / higher valued rewards. The type of loot chests earned from daily and season rewards will be based on the highest league achieved during the previous season. The new reward share system will also penalize players using the starter cards by negating some reward shares for every starter card in your deck. This is to encourage players to use decks with NFT cards, thereby decreasing the value of starter cards and increasing the value of NFT cards. If youre looking for a more comprehensive analysis of the earnings vs expenditure calculations of the game, I highly recommend givinga read.  Splinterlands has a three token economy comprising of Each of these tokens has its own utility, which plays a vital role in maintaining the games economy. Let us have a look at each of them in better detail. Dark Energy Crystals (DEC) is the official reward token of Splinterlands. It is earned through winning matches in the game. The token is always pegged to maintain the value of 1000 DEC = $1. As a result, the official daily reward pool, which is fixed at 1 million DEC, fluctuates based on the price of DEC. For instance, when the price of 1000 DEC falls below $1, the reward pool size falls below 1 million DEC, and vice versa. Dark Energy Crystals Splinterlands This daily reward pool is split and earned by players at varying rates based on several factors, such as the players current league, the number of players playing on the day, the DEC capture rate, and other active bonuses. To maintain the utility and value of DEC, the token is burnt through various use cases. The most notable, in my opinion, is being the official currency to purchase miniset packs in the game. Each pack in the shop can be purchased with 1000 DEC per dollar, irrespective of whether DEC is trading at $1. If 1000 DEC is worth less than $1, players can purchase the packs at a discount driving up the demand for the token to buy more packs. DEC Price History DEC currently trades at $0.00114 per token, placing it slightly above the $1 peg per 1000 DEC. The token hit an all-time high of $0.016 in October 2021 and an all-time low of 0.00048877 in March 2021. DEC can be bought atand. Credits are similar to DEC; both tokens are pegged to 1000 = $1. However, unlike DEC, Credits are not tradeable on secondary markets. They can only be used to redeem for packs or other items in the Splinterlands marketplace. Credits act as a closed-loop internal currency of the game. Splinterlands has balanced its referral/affiliate system by crediting users with Credits as a part of its commission payout. This prevents mass dumping or gaming of the affiliate system by malicious actors. Each credit earned goes towards purchasing packs or renting cards within the marketplace, promoting a healthy market economy. Players can purchase credits with PayPal or any accepted cryptocurrency. Splintershards Splintershards or SPS is a BEP-20 governance token of Splinterlands. The SPS token holders can stake their SPS to vote on the proposal put forward by the DAO. Each staked SPS token will be worth one vote, meaning the more SPS tokens a person holds, the greater influence they will have over the voting results. Additionally, anyone can submit a governance proposal for voting as long as they pay a price in SPS tokens that will be burned. SPS has a total supply of 3 billion tokens with a steady release schedule that lasts for approximately 65 months from when the token first launched. The token supply was allocated in the following manner: Splinterlands is also launching validator nodes to allow the community to validate transactions within the game and earn SPS for doing so. These validator nodes will be used to secure the DAO governance on the Hive blockchain. Validator nodes will follow a delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) consensus model which will allow even people without a node to delegate their SPS to a validator and take a share in the block rewards. The SPS validator software will be 100% open source and available for anyone to download and run without any costs or restrictions. Results of Splinterlands Validator Node License Sales as of Day 2 In order to further incentivize a larger participation in the validation process and further decentralize the application, the Splinterlands team has introduced the concept of Validator Licenses. Holders of Licenses are guaranteed a share of the monthly SPS rewards as long as they run an active node. This means that instead of the usual 100-150 validators winning block rewards in DPoS chains, a far greater number of validators will share SPS rewards in Splinterlands validation process. Node Operators can also hold multiple validator licenses on a single node and enjoy additional rewards from all of them. In terms of Rewards, there are 3,750,000 SPS tokens per month allocated to a reward pool for SPS Validator Node operators. 10% will be devoted to block validation rewards (375,000), and the remaining 3,375,000 SPS / month will be split equally between all of the license holders that are actively running the node software. Currently, the validator node licenses are up for sale on the official Splinterlands website. The licenses seem to be selling out quite well as the pre-sale sold out all 2000 licenses within the first 10 minutes. At the time of writing, the sale is in tranche 1 with over 315 licenses sold. SPS Price History The SPS token is currently trading at $0.08 with an all time high of $1.07 on July of 2021 and an all-time low of $0.05 in May of 2022. The tokens current price is close to its all time lows. SPS can be bought at , ,  and . SPS can be staked on the official Splinterlands website. However, once staked, SPS tokens are subject to an unstaking period of 4 weeks. The tokens will be released into the liquid supply at a rate of 1/4 per week for 4 weeks. Players receive SPS rewards for staking SPS. 2022 Roadmap Splinterlands via One of the more immediate features players can expect in Q2 of this year happens to be the modified version of the ranked mode. With the successful release and sale of the chaos packs, there are now far more sets of cards in the ecosystem that newer players might not be able to collect or compete with some of the older, rarer cards. Splinterlands is launching the Modern and Wild ranked formats to deal with this. The modern format will be more friendly to newer players as it restricts the number of playable cards to the latest two sets- Chaos and Untamed. On the other hand, the wild format is more diverse and will allow players to use any card from any set or edition. The launch of the SPS validator node is also another feature to look forward to, as players can now actively earn SPS and have a greater degree of control in the direction of the game. The introduction of lands and the release of items and spell cards is another feature that I find the most tempting. While I love the gameplay of Splinterlands, I wouldnt mind a bit more control and strategy during the battle. The introduction of the item and spell cards makes this possible. TCGs have always held a special place in my heart, and Splinterlands is currently one of the best in the blockchain gaming space. However, it did take me a couple of tries before getting the hang of the game. While the gameplay is fairly simple to understand, the competition gets quite intense in the higher leagues. To compete at the top level, you require quite a number of cards to rank up and qualify. The game could burn a nice hole in your pocket if you are not deliberate in your card purchases or rentals. The calculations for the play to earn mechanics can be a little confusing for new players, but thankfully the Splinterlands community has a good number of content creators who make the journey easier for fresh players. I highly recommend checking outYouTube channel if youre a new player looking for some helpful tips. If youve managed to stick around till the end of this long article, its safe to say that Splinterlands has caught your interest. So what are you waiting for?

25,2022-06-07,"Crypto.com Review 2022: A Robust All-in-One Crypto Solution",https://www.coinbureau.com/review/crypto-com-mco/," If youve been around the crypto space for more than a day, chances are youve heard of Crypto.com, which is what brings you to this Crypto.com review. After all, they have the word crypto, right in the name, a brilliant marketing move no doubt. The domain crypto.com was actually registered all the way back in 1993 by Matt Blaze (cool name!), who was a well-known cryptographer, and possible fortune teller as he knew that crypto was going to be big someday, purchasing the domain before anyone really even knew what the heck crypto was. So, how did the domain name Crypto.com go from being owned by a guy with a superhero name to becoming owned by one of the most well-established, well-respected crypto behemoths in the world? That is exactly what we are going to dive into today, the full breakdown of the robust Crypto.com platform, the history, the features, and more. Disclaimer: I use the Crypto.com card, the Crypto.com platform and hold CRO token as part of my cryptocurrency investment strategy.  Page Contents  [] As this is a long review and there is A LOT to unpack here as the platform has a tonne of features, I thought I would provide our readers with a quick summary for those who are pressed for time. Summary: It is a fantastic platform, providing nearly everything a crypto user could want in one convenient, secure, super easy to use app. The team is investing a lot into research and development as well, meaning the platform is just going to keep getting better. Heres what I particularly liked about it: Headquarters: Singapore Year Established: 2016 Product Features: Crypto buy, sell, swap. Fiat deposits/withdrawals. Earn, Supercharger, NFT Marketplace, Crypto card, Exchange, DeFi Wallet, Crypto.com Pay, Crypto Assets Supported: 250+ Platform Token: Cronos (CRO) Security + Safety: High KYC/AML Verification: Yes Fiat Currency Support: AUD, CAD, EUR, GBP, USD, USDC, BRL Deposit/Withdrawal Methods: Credit/Debit CardBank Transfer via SEPA, FPS, ACH, NPP, E-Transfer, Fast Network, SWIFT Regulations and Licenses: Dubai Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority Virtual Financial Asset (VFA) license Electronic Money Institution (EMI) license in Europe Australian Financial Services License Financial Institution License and Class 3 VFA license. Crypto.com is a robust all-in-one home for a multitude of cryptocurrencies and features. 2021 was a huge year for crypto as exchanges such as FTX, Binance, and Crypto.com, seriously upped their game, offering everything under the sun that a crypto trader or hodler could want. Image via Crypto.com There was a time when crypto users would need to spread themselves out over various platforms, you would do your trading on one platform, access earning products on another, use a crypto card on another, invest in a launchpad someplace else, and so on It was a bit of a pain, to be honest. In the early days, it was common to have accounts at 5 or 6 different exchanges and platforms as they all specialized in different areas, but now fortunately, the big exchanges in the space have grown to offer multiple solutions under one roof, simplifying the life of crypto users. Crypto.com is headquartered in Singapore with physical locations around the world. They have over 4,000 employees and boast having the worlds fastest-growing crypto app with over 50 million users buying and selling over 250 cryptocurrencies at true cost. They were the first to launch a metal crypto cashback card which went on to become the worlds most popular crypto card. the platform has a convenient earn section to earn passive income on your hodl stash, an NFT marketplace, a non-custodial wallet with access to DApps, the easiest launchpad type feature that Ive ever used and more which we will cover in detail later. Crypto.coms Vision. Image via Crypto.com Crypto.com is fully regulated and supported in most countries around the world including many US States. Crypto.com became the first global cryptocurrency platform to receive a Class 3 Virtual Financial Assets (VFA) License from Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA), they hold a Financial Institution License, secured an Australian Financial Service License (AFSL), and are FDIC insured, making Crypto.com one of the most regulated and licensed cryptocurrency companies. If you are in the market for a first, or an additional cryptocurrency platform to the one you already use, Crypto.com is definitely one to consider. The company was founded by Bobby Bao, Gary Or, Kris Marszalek, and Rafael Melo in 2016, under the original name Monaco. In the first half of 2017, Monaco launched their own token MCO, which was done through an ICO where the team managed to raise approximately $26 million dollars. The Original Founders are Still on the Executive Team Which is Usually a Good Sign of Confidence. Image via crypto.com In 2018, the company rebranded to Crypto.com after they purchased the domain name for $12 million dollars, then shortly after started shipping the Crypto.com Visa Card which paid users cashback in MCO token. At around the same time, the company announced the launch of the Crypto.com Chain with the native CRO token. There was quite a bit of confusion at the introduction of a second platform token. The MCO token was eventually phased out as the CRO token became the primary driver of the Crypto.com platform, replacing the cashback rewards and other MCO token functions. This whole process caused quite a lot of drama for many upset users in the Crypto.com community, but it was a necessary strategic step if Crypto.com was to create its own blockchain and build out a Crypto.com ecosystem. A Quote from Co-Founder and CEO Kris Marszalek had this to say about the rebrand: Crypto.com gives us a powerful new identity in line with our original vision to put cryptocurrency in every wallet. As the name we are taking on is also representative of the entire space, it comes with a huge responsibility to carry the torch. We will strive to deliver impact worthy of the name and build infrastructure that enables growth of the ecosystem, delivering on the promise of a decentralized future. It was a highly controversial move that outraged a lot of MCO holders. In the interest of keeping this article reasonable length, I wont go into all the details on the drama, the events leading up to and following the switch, the why, and the how, if you want to learn more you can check out this article from Crypto Vantage on the The Crypto.com platform had proven to be so successful that in 2019, they launched their own cryptocurrency exchange to entice more users to the platform. Crypto swaps, buying, and selling can take place on the platform, the exchange platform is geared more towards active crypto traders. The Crypto.com platform and Crypto.com Exchange are separate platforms and apps, which I will touch on a bit more later. Why Crypto Matters According to Crypto.com. Image via Crypto.com Later that year, the company went on a feature launching tangent, releasing Crypto.com Pay, Crypto Earn, Crypto Credit, and offered the massively popular crypto card to the American market. In 2020, the company launched its own non-custodial DeFi wallet and DeFi swap services, while also phasing out the MCO token completely. Fast forward to 2021 and 2022, Crypto.com has made some massive strides in marketing and building out its ecosystem. They are dedicated to becoming a household name for crypto and have spared no expense. Here are a few of their largest marketing plays and Sponsorships: Then, of course, there was the Fortune Favours the Brave advert and campaign which stars Matt Damon, directed by Oscar-winner Wally Pfister that highlights the companys own ethos, while inspiring those who want to change the course of history. Matt Damon had this to say about the campaign: Much like what were doing with Water.org, Crypto.com is a cryptocurrency platform that shares my commitment to empowering people around the globe with the tools needed to take control of their futures. They have built a crypto platform that is accessible and puts people first. Here is a look at the Crypto.com Arena, pretty spiffy looking I must say: If Youre Going to Make a Statement, Make it Big with an Arena! Image via Crypto.com Crypto.com is on a mission to accelerate the worlds transition to cryptocurrency, blockchain, and Web 3, by democratizing blockchain technology and designing beautiful, simple, and useful financial services. Image via The Crypto.Com platform can be used for buying, selling, and swapping crypto, as well as has a convenient fiat on and offramp, making the swap from bank to crypto, and back to bank seamless. The Crypto.com platform is not suitable for day traders as there is little charting functionality and no support for technical indicators. Users will need to use the Crypto.com Exchange platform for those features, which can synchronize easily with the Crypto.com platform making it a nice one-two combo. A Look at the Difference Between the Exchange App and Platform App The platform does allow users to set up things like recurring buys and price targets though, so you dont need to use the additional exchange to snipe good price entries or to set up recurring buys to take advantage of dollar-cost averaging. There are also price alerts that can be set up, so the app has you covered for basic crypto buying and selling. If you are interested in learning more about how to trade and technical analysis, we happen to have an article all about , or if you prefer video format, Guy also has a three-part series on  to help take your trading to the next level. The introduction of the metal cashback crypto cards from Crypto.com was a key pillar that launched Crypto.com into the spotlight and mass adoption. Upon launch, the Crypto.com card was the only metal crypto card available on the market, and offered the highest cash back rewards in the industry, making it instantly the most popular crypto card. Image via Crypto.com Since then, other crypto companies have started releasing highly competitive cards as well, resulting in the Crypto.com card no longer being the only great crypto card on the market. If you are in the market for a crypto card, be sure to check out our article on . Spoiler alert: the Crypto.com card is on the list. Im going to be honest here, the Crypto.com card *was* head and shoulders above the competition until May 2022 when Crypto.com announced they were going to be lowering cashback rewards on the cards, capping monthly reward limits, and cutting staking rewards for the CRO stake needed to access higher card tiers.  This left most Crypto.com users seriously p*ssed off, myself included, I was gutted!  Guy was also affected by this as he is also a Crypto.com card holder and made a video to go over what had changed which covers the event in good detail.  Twitter became an absolute flurry of customer fury, seeing thousands of angry tweets, with some customers going as far as posting videos of themselves lighting their cards on fire, throwing them in the garbage, and breaking them in half. As much as it sucked, it was quite amusing. Images via Twitter Crypto.com customers criticized the company for spending too much on sponsorship deals, resulting in loyal customers being walked on with rewards being cut. Crypto.com did cite that the reasons for reducing rewards were over business model and CRO supply sustainability concerns. After massive amounts of customer backlash, Crypto.com realized they went too far and revised the card rewards, though they still are not nearly as good as they were. Fury aside, the cards are available on a tiered basis. The cashback, staking APY, and other rewards depend on how much CRO token users want to stake, the more you stake, the better the perks. The staked CRO needs to be locked up for 6 months when customers first opt in to the program or if they choose to upgrade. After 6 months, customers can unstake the tokens if they no longer wish to have those tier benefits. The lowest entry card is free but provides 0 perks for anyone who just wants a cool metal crypto card. The free card used to provide 1% cashback which was pretty good for a no-strings-attached metal crypto card. The highest tier gets you 5% cashback in CRO (down from 8%) and to access this card you need to lock and stake an eye-watering 400k USD. Instead of me covering all the perks and benefits, here is a convenient image from their site that sums it all up: Image via Crypto.com To summarize the card, people are furious as they invested a serious amount of money into CRO to receive the amazing perks, only to feel like they were rug pulled as the company backtracked on their offerings which has resulted in the card not being nearly as good as it was, and no longer the best card on the market. Is it still a good card? For sure! Getting a Spotify and Netflix rebate alone is pretty sweet, and the card is amazing for travelling as users can enjoy fee-free ATM withdrawals, free currency exchange transactions, and free interbank exchange rates. Though the perks have been reduced, I still use mine daily as no traditional bank card comes close to being as good, and being able to use the card regardless of what country you are in without worrying about exchange rate penalties and fees is a serious hassle-saver. While the changes were a bit of a kick in the teeth for existing customers, it is still a great choice for newcomers though I can no longer say it is the best card out there. Earning passive APY on crypto has become a staple for many of us in the crypto scene. If I cant stake, lend, farm, or somehow earn something back on my hodl stash, I generally wont bother with the platform. May as well get the best bang for your buck! Crypto.com has a convenient earn section in both the platform and the DeFi wallet, I will cover more about the wallet later. On the platform, users can earn an attractive APY of up to 11% on crypto and up to 10% on stablecoins. A Look at the Earn Section in the Crypto.com App Users can deposit cryptocurrencies and earn interest in over 50 different coins and tokens with more being added all the time. There are three holding terms users can choose from: Here is a look at the rates table as of June 2022 showing the returns that customers can expect: Image via Crypto.com Crypto.com Pay is a payment solution powered by Crypto.org. It is a mobile payment service that lets users pay, or get paid in crypto for free, anywhere, anytime. The feature is run on the Crypto.org Chain, Crypto.coms native blockchain, and provides the following benefits: Here is a look at some of the benefits from the customer and merchant perspective: Image via crypto.com whitepaper At the moment, there are 4 main features of Crypto.com Pay: Supercharger is a fantastic feature on the platform. It is a simple, flexible, and secure rewards feature that allows users to stake tokens with no lock-in restrictions, and earn popular crypto rewards on the Crypto.com Exchange and Crypto.com App. Supercharger works similar to a launchpad, though Supercharger rewards can also be paid out in old school coins like Bitcoin. Supercharger is where users can stake tokens and passively earn reward tokens from projects, ranging from new listings on the platform, start-up projects, , , , you name it. By navigating to the Supercharger section, users will see a charging period for the current event, along with what token is being offered for the event reward. During that time, users can stake and withdraw their tokens in a rewards pool as often as they wish. Then the acceptance period will follow, where users must accept their reward based on the rewards score they accumulated during the Charging Period. Here is a look at a couple of different screenshots showing parts of the process for different events:  After the acceptance period, users will receive daily rewards during the reward period for whatever the token reward was, as is highlighted during the charging period. I really like this feature as it can be done automatically and passively. Users can stake their tokens and select for them to be automatically rolled into the next Supercharger event, allowing the user to sit back and relax while earning multiple different tokens that are simply deposited into their account on a daily basis. It is like playing an airdrop lottery, and once the reward tokens are deposited into a users account, they can swap them for other tokens, stake em, hodl em, or do whatever they want with them. This can be quite lucrative if the event is for some new token that is yet to see wide adoption. You can learn more about this in the Crypto.com help section on . The Crypto.com platform is only available on IOS and Android mobile devices. The company states that for security reasons they do not have a web platform, which has some logic to it as computers are more prone to malware and viruses than mobile devices. The Crypto.com App. Image via The Crypto.com Exchange can be accessed via the mobile application or web browser so traders can perform their technical analysis setups and perform their trading from a larger screen, which makes sense as active day trading from a tiny screen would be a pain. The mobile app is a breeze to use, and it is designed brilliantly. I often find that feature-packed apps that try and do too many things can be difficult to navigate as it can be cluttered and easy to get lost in, but the Crypto.com team did a great job designing the UI/UX with the user in mind, they managed to pack a lot in while still managing to keep the screen free of clutter. There isnt much in the way of needing improvement, that I can say about the app, it really is a powerful crypto powerhouse tool that provides users with just about everything they need to unbank themselves all in one place. The only gripe I have with it is that sometimes it can be slow to start up, taking longer than it should to prompt for a pin/fingerprint and actually start up. A minor inconvenience. Reviews of the app seem to echo my overall positive sentiment with an average rating of 3.8 stars out of 5, I would personally have rated it a bit higher to be honest, but that is just my opinion: Image via Many of the negative reviews are people also mentioning that the app is running slow and being slow to load as I mentioned as well. The lower than deserved rating comes from some unsubstantiated complaints such as there being no way to sell all (there is), complaints about there being no live customer service (there is), a complaint about not being able to swap tokens (you definitely can), and then some legitimate complaints about the app crashing and failing to open on some devices, which I never experienced. Crypto.com NFTs is an NFT platform that aims to deliver unique content from popular artists, musicians, athletes, and sports. Any user can become an NFT creator by minting their own NFTs on the platform and list their collectables for sale in the NFT marketplace. Image via crypto.com The NFT marketplace is very user friendly and allows users to purchase NFTs using a card or Crypto.com Pay. Here is a look at some of the top collectables: Image via Crypto.com NFTs are supported on the Ethereum and Crypto.org chain. Crypto.com has created a new DeFi protocol aptly named  This protocol can currently be interacted with via the Crypto.com wallet browser extension, any wallet supported by WalletConnect, and will soon be integrated with the Crypto.com DeFi wallet. Image via For anyone familiar with , Crypto.coms DeFi Swap will feel very similar. Crypto.com has designed it to be what they state is the best place to swap and farm DeFi coins at the best available rate. Liquidity Providers (LPs) are incentivized for contributing to liquidity pools with Triple Yield through: The five main functions of the protocol are: While buying, selling, swapping, fiat deposits and withdrawals are available within the Crypto.com platform, they also have a separate stand-alone exchange platform that can be accessed via a separate mobile app or web platform. Image via Crypto.com The specifics of the exchange are outside the scope of this article, we will be doing a detailed Crypto.com Exchange review in the near future to cover it in more detail, but in short, the exchange has the following features: To learn more about the Crypto.com Exchange, I recommend checking out their help article on the Crypto.com does not charge any fees for crypto deposits or withdrawals within the Crypto.com ecosystem. Withdrawals to external addresses have fees that vary greatly depending on the token and network. Crypto.com fees can be found on the Crypto Withdrawals page which can be found within the app, which looks something like this:  In order to deposit fiat onto the platform, your best bet is bank transfer as debit/credit card purchases can set you back up to 4%. Bank transfers are free to and from the platform except for USDC, which is awesome, with the following methods being supported depending on your location: For fiat deposits, users can deposit as little as $1 over the SEPA and FPS network for European and UK based customers, while Americans using ACH have a $20 dollar minimum, and a $1,000 dollar minimum for standard wire transfers. The website states that deposits can take a few days, but in my experience using SEPA, deposits happen in seconds. Here are the stated deposit times: For crypto purchases, I did mention there can be up to a 4% charge, a little clarity here would be nice in my opinion. If you are making a big purchase, the difference between 1% and 4% can be quite significant. I also came across this in their fees section which makes me go hmmm. Image via Crypto.com So, it sounds like you are basically playing lucky dip when making a purchase and have no idea what fees you will be paying, and Crypto.com may charge an additional admin fee if they are feeling frisky. I gotta dock them points here as I like clarity in my fee structure, and that isnt too much to ask. After all,  and  both provide very clear and transparent fee structures, meaning you know exactly what to expect. For Crypto.com fees related to the exchange, that information can be found on their  page. Ah, the all-important question of asset support. There is no point in signing up for a platform if they do not support your favourite assets. Crypto.com has an impressive list of over 250+ crypto assets, supporting the majors, and many difficult to find tokens. It is also a great place to pick up some Ripple XRP as many major exchanges have delisted it due to the . Surprisingly, Crypto.com also supports platform tokens and networks for competitors, supporting Binances BNB token and many BEP2 tokens, as well as tokens on the BSC chain (BEP20) which is great to see. I find it a bit petty when exchanges dont list tokens for competitors, as all that is going to do is drive users to the competing platform if they are bullish on that platforms token. For those who like to take full responsibility for their crypto, Crypto.com has created a non-custodial Crypto.com DeFi Wallet so users can seamlessly swap between the platform and the wallet that they hold the private keys for. Image via Crypto.com The Crypto.com Wallet offers the following features: The Crypto.com Wallet is a clean looking, intuitive, secure, and easy to use crypto wallet suitable for all levels of crypto user, though users who need more robust, technical and advanced features may opt for wallets like Electrum or . Image via Crypto.com If you are in the market for a new crypto wallet, we break down the different types in our article on the . The Crypto.com Wallet supports over 100 coins, and tokens can be purchased directly within the wallet for ultimate convenience.  support is big these days as well and the Crypto.com Wallet does not disappoint here. Users can view their NFTs, along with the NFT description, attributes, drop, and creator information. Within the wallet, users also have access to the Cronos Bridge, DApps built on the , Cronos, and Binance Smart Chain through an in-app DApp browser, and WalletConnect. There is also a browser-based wallet extension for use on desktop, similar to . Here is a quick visual showing the advantages and disadvantages of the Crypto.com App vs Wallet. Image via crypto.com whitepaper Users can also access DeFi Swap in the wallet, allowing them to exchange tokens directly in the wallet while accessing coins that can be farmed at the best available rate, leveraging audited farming protocols. DeFi Earn allows users to generate yield on over 35 different tokens which is done by accessing the different DApps that are integrated within the wallet, such as , ,  and more. Image via Crypto.com The Crypto.com Wallet is a pretty underrated crypto wallet in my opinion, and next time we update our article on the Top 8 mobile wallets, it will definitely be making the cut and added there. The fact that the wallet supports NFTs, swapping tokens, seamless earning and farming by conveniently integrated DApps, purchasing crypto, and can access protocols hosted on Ethereum, BSC, Cronos, and Cosmos makes this one of the most multi-functional wallets available. Crypto.com places a strong emphasis on the security of company and user funds, as every cryptocurrency platform should. The team drives a Zero Trust and Defence in Depth security strategy across all their systems and platforms. Data privacy assessments are built directly into the processes that protect user information. Image via Crypto.com The security team screen all deposits for compliance and have a team that manually monitors all transactions on the platform. According to the teams : As far as security features, Crypto.com follows a Secure Software Development Lifecycle, meaning the software undergoes peer reviews and undergoes a combination of static and dynamic source code analysis. Image via Crypto.com Transactions are protected by Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) which includes passwords, biometrics, email, phone, and authenticator validation, and whitelisting of withdrawal addresses is mandatory. For the sticklers who are interested in what certifications and standards are met by Crypto.com, here you go: So, users of the platform can sleep soundly at night knowing that Crypto.com is one of the most secure platforms available. However, in full transparency, the platform did experience a pretty significant hack in early 2022 resulting in lost customer funds. Image via The breach was caused by an issue with failed 2FA authentication integration with the platform. This black eye to their reputation led to Crypto.com adding additional 2FA and multi-factor authentication safeguards to the platform, and beefing up their security protocols. A Crypto.com account can be opened and verified in about ten minutes if everything goes alright with the ID verification step. Accounts are free and very easy to set up, here is the 6-step process on what it looks like to open an account: Pro Tip: Never search for crypto apps directly in an app store due to multiple fake app download links from scammers that are nearly indistinguishable from the real app. Always hit the download link from the company website. Now the unverified account isnt going to let you do much, so you are going to need to go through the KYC verification. To verify your account, you will need the following: If you have got that ready, this is the next 6-step process to verify your account: While Crypto.com was not my first exchange, they were my platform of choice when I decided to get serious and unbank myself, living solely off of crypto. This means that I reached out to their support team A LOT as I was flailing ungracefully, plunging deeper into the world of crypto. At first, Crypto.com support wasnt great, which seems to be a common theme with crypto companies. But after the 2021 bull run, they really ramped up their support services and now I cant really find fault with their support at all. My preferred method of contacting Crypto.com support is through in-app chat functionality, any platform that doesnt support live chat needs to get with the times IMO, email support can be too slow. When using Crypto.com live chat feature, a member of the support team typically gets back to me within 30 minutes to 3 hours. A View of the Live Chat Feature in the Crypto.com App I recently had a bit of a unique case with them that involved collaboration with multiple team members over the span of 4 or 5 days, and they were so professional, friendly, and stayed on the chat with me the entire time, even having to go out of their way a bit to provide me with fantastic service, so a huge shout out to their support team from this crypto guy. Other than live chat, they can also be emailed at contact@crypto.com for questions or queries but live chat seems to be their primary support method. The team is also active and responsive on , and they have a well built out  that should be able to address most questions or issues. There is often some confusion around the Crypto.com ecosystem as they have two chains, Cronos and Crypto.org. You will see this if you go to withdraw CRO on the network, there will be three choices in how you want to withdraw your CRO:  ERC20 is for the Ethereum network. I am assuming you know what Ethereum is, so no need to cover that here, but what about Cronos and CRO? Crypto.com created the Crypto.org chain, and in their words is a Next Generation Public Blockchain. It is a public, open-source and permissionless blockchain that is fully decentralized with high speed and low fees. The mainnet beta is live, and the chain pledges to be carbon negative by 2023. It is being designed to be a public good protocol that will aid in driving mass adoption, supporting use cases like payments, DeFi, and NFTs. Image via Cronos is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible chain running in parallel to the Crypto.org Chain. The settlement currency of the Cronos network is the CRO token, the backbone of the Cronos and Crypto.com ecosystem. The value propositions for the Cronos chain are: Both Crypto.org and Cronos are blockchains that have been built on the Cosmos SDK, which allows them a higher level of interoperability. Cronos is ETH compatible while Crypto.org is a standalone network. Image via crypto.com whitepaper The reason for the two chains is similar to what Binance did with their Binance Chain () and their Binance Smart Chain (BEP20). The primary use for Crypto.org is to allow for fast transactions and very low fees, promoting mass adoption and serving a similar purpose to what the Binance Smart Chain does for the Binance ecosystem. The primary function of Cronos is to allow decentralized applications to be built on the platform using smart contracts. Cronos adopts the CRC20 token standard, similar to how BSC is BEP20 and Ethereum is ERC20. Here is a look at the quickly growing Cronos ecosystem: Image via One thing I really like about Crypto.com is that it is a fully built out, robust ecosystem where crypto traders can do just about everything under the sun without needing to leave the Crypto.com framework. It was very convenient for me when I was earning a salary in cryptocurrency as my employer could send BTC to my Crypto.com account, and from there I could convert it into fiat, or other crypto, stash it away in an Earn account for savings, and of course, spend my salary while earning cashback with the Crypto.com card. It was incredibly convenient and was my first experience truly being able to unbank myself. While the Crypto.com exchange and platform are massively popular, I feel that the wallet and the Cronos and Crypto.org chains are very underutilized and underappreciated in their utility and use cases and unrecognized for their capabilities and innovation. This is something that I feel could see massive adoption and a surge in popularity come the next bull run, and sustainably grow as the industry grows as a whole.  We have seen the titan that the Binance and BSC ecosystems have become, and I feel that Cronos could be seeing similar levels of growth, use, and adoption over time as it looks like Crypto.com are looking to learn from what Binance has created, and as any good competitor does, aim to make it better. Overall, Crypto.com is a great platform, users likely wont be disappointed as it is a very comprehensive, fully encompassing ecosystem where the needs of nearly every crypto user can be met. Crypto.com are one of the major players in the space and is definitely one worth using and watching as they are taking the appropriate steps to build a truly massive ecosystem that aims to propel the entire industry forward while remaining suitable for the little person who just wants a bit of crypto in their lives. Yes, Crypto.com follows industry best practices when it comes to security and regulation. They are highly respected in the industry, used and trusted by millions of users worldwide. They hold some of the highest licenses available in the crypto industry and exceed many industry standards. and Crypto.com fill different roles in the industry. Crypto.com has an entirely built out crypto ecosystem with the Cronos and Crypto.org chain and the native CRO token. Crypto.com is way more than just a place to buy and sell crypto. Coinbases strength is as a basic exchange that is perfect for beginners. Users who want a fully built out, robust crypto ecosystem will likely choose Crypto.com over Coinbase. Crypto.com also has lower fees on average than Coinbase. Users who want a simple, no-frills exchange experience will likely opt for Coinbase if they are okay with the fees. Crypto.com and FTX fill different roles in the industry. Crypto users who want to participate in a full crypto-centric ecosystem that can do everything crypto-related will likely opt for Crypto.com as it has the DeFi Wallet and is Cosmos SDK and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible. is better suited for traders who are looking to actively trade crypto, derivatives, and stocks. Both platforms are incredibly fee friendly and have well built out Earn and NFT sections. FTX does not have its own chain, but heavily utilizes the Ethereum and Solana networks. As Crypto.com is committed to the future of blockchain, they have taken ambitious steps in creating an entire crypto framework and are contributing massively to the entire industry, leaving many investors bullish on the project. Binance did something similar and was handsomely rewarded, becoming the second biggest crypto ecosystem after Ethereum. Crypto.com is building on what Binance has done, aiming to create a more efficient crypto ecosystem to rival the likes of Binance and Ethereum. Users who feel that advancing the crypto industry in this way are bullish on projects that undertake this feat, and many investors feel that Crypto.com is standing on a strong foundation to successfully see their ambitions roll out to fruition.

30,2022-06-01,"Digital Land: Investing in The Metaverse",https://www.coinbureau.com/education/digital-land-investing-metaverse/," As crypto investors, we are often seen as being a few fries short of a Happy Meal from traditional investors and no coiners. We do sit at the brunt of a lot of criticism and scepticism in the investment space, didnt you hear the news? Warren Buffett not only thinks Bitcoin is rat poison, but Remember that Mr. Buffett also passed on Amazon and Microsoft stocks in the early days. The Oracle from Omaha has been wrong about a few things, so I dont let that bother me. Mr. Buffett talks about Bitcoin the way a heartbroken high school kid slanders their ex on social media after a bad breakup. Warren, what did that mean old Bitcoin do to you? Maybe they are right, maybe our elevator doesnt go to the top floor, and perhaps we are the investor equivalent of that guy who tries to eat soup with a fork. Just when they thought we couldnt go any madder as we buy magic rainbow internet money that has no purpose or value, weve raised the crazy bar and are now buying magic imaginary real estate in virtual fairy tale lands. Gif via Tenor If we are crazy, talk about doubling down on our commitment and confidence in digital property. What we are going to explore in this article is digital land and metaverse investing and go over why this concept may not be as crazy as it sounds. Disclaimer: I invest in many of the projects mentioned in this article as part of my personal investment strategy. Nothing in this article is investment advice, metaverse investing is incredibly speculative and high risk. This article is for educational purposes only, do not make investment decisions based on the information presented here.  Page Contents  [] This is a doozy of a question; with no one size fits all answer. Asking what the metaverse is, is akin to asking someone what the internet is. You could ask 100 different people and receive 100 different answers. The one important thing to note is that the metaverse is not just one place, it is a global collaboration, just as the very internet is. If you think about what the internet is, it isnt Google, Facebook, or Amazon, it isnt any single entity like that, it is a global space of information accessible to anyone and contributed to by everyone. The metaverse is evolving to essentially work in a similar fashion and there are already multiple metaverses being built out. Facebook (yeah yeah, now Meta, I know) is building their own metaverse, Sony, Microsoft and Disney are building their own metaverses, and metaverses such as  and  already exist and have a user base. There are literally dozens of metaverses already underway, so it isnt going to be just one place. Image via My personal feeling is that the metaverse is going to be the next evolution or iteration of the internet we already use, a web 3.0 version of the current web 2.0 that the internet is today. The metaverse will work hand in hand, symbiotically alongside web 2. Eventually, the terms metaverse and internet may even be used interchangeably and used synonymously. Much like today, we simply use the term website, a term that hasnt changed for decades even though the underlying technology migrated from pre-HTML, through to HTML 1, HTML 2 all the way to HTML 5, users seldom care as we still just refer to them as websites. The key difference is that instead of accessing the internet with computers and smartphones, we will be fully immersed in these virtual worlds through virtual reality technology. A very simple dumbed down explanation by  sums it up beautifully, stating: I believe that just as you navigate to websites today for different companies and purposes, eventually, we will be navigating to different metaverses instead of websites. Some metaverses will be owned by companies while others will be community-owned and decentralized. These decentralized, community-owned metaverses will be places where companies and users can exist and set up shop as equals, as we have already seen with the likes of  who built the first digital bank in the Decentraland metaverse, and accounting giant Pricewaterhouse Cooper purchased land in the Sandbox metaverse. The Metaverse Will Likely be a Fully Immersive Way to Interact with the Internet. Image via Shutterstock This movement has just started and we are already seeing insurance companies, banks, video game companies, news agencies, advertisement companies and more who are all building within these virtual worlds. To get a firm grasp on what the metaverse and web 3.0 are, as these are massive topics to be explored on their own, we happen to have detailed articles that you should definitely check out. We have a deep dive explaining  and an article on If you are interested in going further down the metaverse rabbit hole, Guy also has a dedicated video on the top virtual land NFT projects: If you believe that the metaverse is the next evolution of the internet, as many do, then it is clear why there is limitless potential. If you asked someone in the early 90s how the internet may impact and shape the future, I doubt anyone would have been able to predict or fathom just how revolutionary the internet would become. The metaverse is likely to eventually encapsulate every company website, and everything we use the internet for today will take place in the metaverse. Gaming, shopping, working, tv and film watching, banking, and countless other things will likely become primarily conducted virtually. If you recall from my article on , an estimated 1/3 of the planets population are considered gamers, a figure that is growing and attracting more people to gaming metaverses. Just as most of us were not aware of our website browsing making the switch from HTML 4 to HTML 5, the 4.95 billion people on the planet who use the internet today, whether they know it or not, will be riding the internet train right into web 3, and potentially, the metaverse. Remember that internet adoption did not happen all at once, it was a trickle of users, that turned into a stream, that turned into a tidal wave, it is probable that metaverse adoption will follow a similar trajectory. Image via If you could go back and own a piece of the internet in the 90s, wouldnt you want to? Many see metaverse investing as a way to actually own a piece of the future infrastructure that will make up a huge part of our daily lives. The opinion that we will be spending the majority of our time in a metaverse is echoed by many such as Microsoft and Facebooks Meta. Metas View of the Metaverse. Image via While a totalitarian metaverse run by Zuckerberg as judge, jury, and executioner, scares the bejesus out of many of us, their  that shows all of us just chilling out and socializing in the metaverse, chatting, playing games, working, and more, I feel is a pretty good portrayal of a metaverse, but how about we use one not controlled by data-hungry, fear-mongering tech giants. Heck, even Mcdonalds, Chipotle and Wendys have launched virtual restaurants in the metaverse, so yeah, its a thing. Gonna Need a Virtual Diet Plan to Work Off These Virtual Calories Image via The metaverse will be accessible by anyone with a simple internet connection. This opens up companies to a potential global customer and client base without the logistical headaches and overhead costs of needing to physically expand your business into other countries. Collaboration will be able to thrive and exist at levels never before possible, creating limitless innovation, the likes of which we cannot even imagine today. Imagine the things that will be possible in a virtual world not restricted by the physical limitations imposed on us in real life. Lets take a look at some fast facts: It is pretty clear as to why there has been billions of dollars flowing into metaverse investment and development as this is likely going to be the place we all hang out in the near future. Think every hour we spend staring at screens now will likely translate directly to time spent in the metaverse. But what is digital real estate specifically, and what makes it so attractive? Metaverse real estate is parcels of land or property that exist in virtual worlds. In their most simple sense, they are pixels of land that make up a broader landscape that can be purchased and owned by connecting a cryptocurrency wallet, and accessed through a device with internet connection. Digital land is more than just digital images as they are programmable. Users can design them how they want and spend time there. Think of it like Minecraft but the key difference being that you actually own your items, can transfer them out of the world, and sell them for real-world monetary value. A Look at the Land Parcels Owned by Users in the Sandbox Metaverse. Image via Sandbox A common misconception about virtual real estate is that you need technical skills to participate which isnt the case for most metaverses. Popular metaverses like Decentraland have an intuitive drag and drop interface where users can create whatever they like with no coding skills required. With the rise of the metaverse, which attracts investor, company, and retail interest, the digital real estate industry is expected to grow. The virtual real estate market experienced a boom in 2021 after Facebook changed its name to Meta and announced its focus on creating a metaverse. As popularity in metaverses grows, virtual real estate is forecasted to have a . You might be asking yourself why anyone would want to invest in digital land, as it does seem a strange concept. After all, you cant build physical property on it, you cant physically live on it, and you might even be thinking it isnt even scarce. The planet earth only has a finite amount of land, which is what makes land valuable in attractive areas. A common criticism against virtual land is that we can create endless virtual worlds with limitless virtual land. We could create so much virtual land that everyone on the planet could have free access to as much land as they want, reducing any value in digital real estate at all. Anyone with any basic economic understanding realizes right away why investing in something with a limitless supply isnt always the best idea. This is one of Bitcoins strongest narratives over fiat currency as there is nothing stopping the Fed from creating new money out of thin air as we have seen in record numbers since the pandemic. Bitcoins finite supply is one of the reasons many people believe that there should be a Bitcoin standard and why Image via The ability to create an endless supply of digital land is a very valid concern, and one of the things that make metaverse investing so risky. A good metaverse investment comes down to the popularity/adoption of a metaverse and something known as network effect. We see how impactful and important network effect is on social media sites with Facebook being a great example. Everyone you talk to seems to hate Facebook and emperor Zuckerberg, yet everyone still uses it. Why? Simple, because everyone else is already there. If all your friends, family and favourite brands are on Facebook, as much as you may hate it, what is the alternative choice? You could go and start up your own, or find an alternative social media site, but if nobody else follows you, its no fun and pretty lonely being the only person using a different social media site. When None of your Friends use MySpace Anymore. Gif via VSGIF.com Metaverse dominance will have the same network effect principles in play. The two largest metaverses in terms of active users today are the Sandbox and Decentraland. Both of these metaverses have a finite supply of land, giving it value. In fact, plots of land in Decentraland have been selling for millions of dollars which is astonishing! Who would have thought that digital land would be selling for more than physical land? Once you dive into it as we will in the next sections, you will see why this isnt as crazy as you initially think. Fashion Street Estate in Decentraland sold for $3.5 Million (618,000 MANA) Image via decentraland.org As mentioned, there is finite land available in metaverses like Decentraland and the Sandbox, and similar to how a plot of land in a place like New York is going to cost considerably more than some backwoods land in the middle of nowhere that nobody wants to visit, these metaverses also have plots of land that cost more as they are in more desirable locations than others. Here is a heatmap showing cost of land in the Sandbox, highlighting that more centrally located plots are more desirable, and therefore, worth more. Image via Snoop Dogg is one of the biggest celebrities who firmly planted a flag in the metaverse. The plot of land beside his mansion in the Sandbox sold for $500k, not because there was anything particularly special about it, other than you get to be neighbours with Snoop Dogg. So, going back to the concern that we can just create another Decentraland or Sandbox, and create more virtual worlds, the network effect is powerful as there is only one Snoop Dogg, and only one tv series: The Walking Dead, and they chose to hang out in the Sandbox. There are already thousands of users in Decentraland, along with Samsung, JP Morgan, Vegas City, and gaming giant  to name a few. So yeah, we can create another world, but I want to hang out in Decentraland, playing Atari. Atari in Decentraland Image via If all your friends are in one metaverse, and gaming giant brands and entertainment companies, along with sporting events and fashion companies that are important to you are in the same metaverse, that network effect reduces the likelihood of newly created metaverses that have none of that devaluing the land owned in an already well-established blue-chip metaverse project. Supply and demand are factors that also play a role in land value within a metaverse ecosystem, but it is ultimately adoption, popularity and network effects (along with useability, of course,) that will give one metaverse value and demand over competing metaverses. These are the main factors that need to be considered when deciding whether or not digital land is a viable investment. Trying to understand why anyone would opt for digital real estate over physical real estate is a hard point to pass across the table to someone who is big on physical assets and traditional investing, and I get it. I am going to take from my own experience here and make a comparison for anyone who is interested in Bitcoin but has not made the leap to understanding the value of digital land yet, as similarities can be drawn by comparing digital land to physical land, as we can compare Bitcoin to physical cash or gold. There are a lot of people in the world whose main financial goal is to own a house with a paid-off mortgage, a sentiment that I agree with, as it is likely the best scenario for most people. Imagine all the extra disposable income you would have if you didnt need to pay rent or a mortgage. Buying a house vs renting is a topic that I have researched at length in the past and is not as black and white for everyone. For example, did you know that in Germany and Switzerland it is more favourable to rent than it is to own? Renting is Preferable to Buying in Germany and Switzerland. Image via Arguments can be made that real estate is a money pit and not always a good investment. In many countries, real estate does not appreciate as well as other assets, and since the 2008 financial crash, real estate has been steadily depreciating in some countries. In many parts of the world, investors would be better off throwing money into an index fund than purchasing a home, but these are topics for another time. Real Estate Investment Profitability is Highly Dependent on Location. Image via For me, I love the idea of having physical real estate, a tangible asset that I can live in and build on, and to know that I always have a roof over my head in case the world goes to hell in a handbasket. I would like to have one physical home for security, not necessarily as an investment, before investing in speculative digital property. Though with that being said, in full transparency for you guys as I dont want to be hypocritical, I actually own digital land and property, but no physical property, which is something I am looking to change. This wasnt entirely my choice, in my article about , I told the story about how I used to earn a salary in Bitcoin, and damn near got laughed out of the bank when I tried to apply for a mortgage. So, I thought screw it, if I cant buy a real home, Im going to buy virtual land and aped into Bloktopia and other projects where I am earning some sweet passive monthly income (more on that later). Image via Availability is a great distinction that separates physical and virtual property. For many of us, getting a mortgage or buying property can be unattainable for multiple reasons. There are far fewer barriers to entry when opting for virtual land, essentially anyone with the internet and the capital can do it. If you can spot good opportunities early, you can get in for a fraction of the cost of physical real estate and the ROI on digital land sales has smashed the physical real estate market out of the park. Some of these plots of land were purchased for mere dollars and later sold for millions, something not seen in the physical realm. If you are on board with Bitcoin, then you likely understand why it is superior to fiat money and gold due to the following principles: You can apply these same principles to digital land vs physical land. Digital land is more durable than physical land Digital land and real estate are not subject to the same hazards as physical property. No need to worry about floods, earthquakes or natural wear and tear, nor do you need to worry about upkeep and maintenance costs. Digital land is more portable than physical land Your virtual real estate can be accessed and utilized from anywhere in the world so long as you have an internet connection. Also, with cross-compatibility with NFTs, if you dont like where your digital house is built, you can pick it up and transplant it somewhere else, even between metaverses someday. Imagine saying you are tired of your apartment in New York, or your neighbourhood has become a rough area, good luck picking up your home with all its furnishings and transplanting it to another country or city. That will be theoretically possible with digital land. You can also sell or transfer your digital real estate nearly instantaneously to anyone located anywhere in the world; borders are a restriction that virtual property does not need to abide by. Digital land is more divisible With , groups of investors can share the cost and get involved with joint ownership of land and real estate far more efficiently and to a greater scalable degree than the traditional real estate industry, without pesky banks and property rights/title deed regulations getting in the way. There is nothing stopping you from drawing a contract up with a group of friends or family and entering a joint venture into digital real estate investing. Plus, with smart contracts, this can all be done in a trustless and permissionless way so you dont need to worry about people backing out of the deal or being shady. Back to the real world, there are rules and regulations in place that stipulate how many names can be on a mortgage, or how many names can be on a property title which can be a burden and a barrier. Blockchain often removes these intermediaries who enforce arbitrary rules, creating a more free and equal system. Digital real estate can have the same principles of scarcity as physical real estate As mentioned, there is a finite supply of land available in some of these metaverses, just as is the case with the real world. While a valid argument is that we can just continually create more virtual worlds, there will still be scarcity driving value if you want prime real estate in prime metaverse locations. Just for fun, here is a chart that shows what factors drive property value from a traditional perspective that we can compare to digital property:    One of the most revolutionary features of the metaverse and digital land is that virtual worlds can be created without the restrictions or restraints that are present in the physical world. Things like gravity, thermodynamics, and physics do not need to be adhered to, meaning that the only limitation is human imagination. Now, admittedly, I am not the most imaginative person on the planet, and I am sure you can come up with more creative and innovative ideas than I can, but what started opening my eyes to the possibilities of the ridiculous beauty that can exist in the metaverse was during the Cardano 2021 virtual summit. The event took place on the back of a giant turtle, surrounded by floating islands which is pretty cool imo. 2021 Cardano Summit. Image via Physical land acquisition has the burdens and hurdles of intermediaries, deeds and titles that need to be transferred, financial party interest, and endless red tape dictating what you can and cannot do with your property. We cant even begin to imagine what the full form of the metaverse will look like with the randomness of a global collaboration of the imaginations without limitations from a global population. Some metaverses will be like something out of a Dr. Seuss picture book times a million. That same imagination can be utilized to figure out the endless ways you can monetize your virtual real estate. You want an underwater M.C. Esher style home complete with friendly dolphins? You can do it, maybe charge a cheeky little entrance fee for visitors. We have already seen virtual concerts from the likes of Post Malone, who rocked out on stage with Pikachu. Ariana Grande, The Weekend, Justin Bieber and Snoop Dogg have also performed in virtual reality venues. Post Malone Performed in a Virtual Concert to Celebrate Pokmons 25th Birthday. Image via If you own a large enough parcel of land, you could be the one to rent it out for these virtual concerts, sports matches, conferences, build virtual movie theatres, arcades, bowling alleys, casinos, you name it! Advertising is also going to be paramount in the metaverse, think about all the advertising that exists on the internet today, that will all need to find a home in the metaverse. If you own land that is likely to see a lot of traffic, advertising and marketing agencies are likely to pay a fortune for the chance to put their brand up at your place. One of the common methods that I have used to earn monthly income from the metaverse is to rent out real estate to companies who want their brand seen in the metaverse. For me, this happens in Bloktopia. This works the same way as renting out office space to tenants in a physical building. My other metaverse income comes from staking and renting out  NFTs to players around the world, so there are a few different ways to capitalize here. As long as you have a piece of land in a metaverse/area that people will want to visit, the sky really is the limit for all the different ways you can monetize it. Or, for a passive approach, many investors are simply flipping digital land as it can often be purchased and then sold later for a profit. This is the million-dollar question that everybody wants to know, isnt it? The truth is, nobody has a crystal ball, and nobody knows which metaverses will succeed and which ones will fail, nor do we even know if virtual real estate is a good investment at all, which is why it is classified as high risk and highly speculative. We could all look back in ten years and go hey, remember when we were all dumb enough to buy virtual land? Then cry into our pile of Beanie Babies and Pogs that we also thought would be worth something someday. How Many People Spent Fortunes on These Thinking They Would Sell for Millions Someday? I Wouldnt Trade a Can of Beans for one Nowadays. Image via Shutterstock When weighing up metaverse investment potential, as with any risky investment, the first thing you should ask yourself is if you have enough disposable money to throw into a metaverse investment. Any money that goes into highly speculative assets like cryptocurrency should be money that you can afford to lose, which is why nearly every financial advisor and honourable crypto personality will tell you that same thing. If I had people in my life who were dependent on my income and I did not own my own home and struggled financially each month, the last thing I would be investing in is metaverse projects. If you do decide to take a crack at metaverse investing, then the traditional methods of valuing real estate should apply to your investment decision. These are things like: Location- Who are the owners of the land in your neighbourhood? Landowners in the Sandbox have raked in masses of income when big brands like Atari, Samsung, and Adidas set up shop next door. Is the location in a desirable area that you will likely be able to sell for a profit later on? Network Effects- Are there enough attractions, brands, and big names in your metaverse to continuously fuel engagement and attract users? Cost Like any investment, there are good times to buy and bad times. Many virtual real estate investors bought in at the peak of the 2021 metaverse mania only to watch the value of their properties drop significantly in value, some as much as 70% or more. Ability to Monetize- The more factors driving traffic to your area will increase your ability to monetize the property and set up additional income streams, or simply increase the value of your investment. How Long You Are Willing to Hold- Many consider metaverse investment as long term with a 5-10+ year outlook. The majority of metaverse real estate sale activity happens in the top two names in the space, Decentraland and Sandbox. These are considered the safest, blue chip metaverse investment plays. Other mentions that are gaining in popularity and growing are the likes of the Solana powered Somnium Space, , Cryptovoxels, , Bloktopia, and the Cardano powered  metaverse, along with many other fantastic looking ones in the pipeline. Image via Sandbox is the leader, dominating approximately 62% of the entire metaverse real estate market. During the 2021 virtual land boom, LAND in the Sandbox was going for an average of $11,000 for a tiny parcel, with higher-end lots going for six figures. Since the hype has died down, Sandbox LAND is now selling for an average price of $3,100. Image via The figures look similar for Decentraland with the average price for a small land plot going for just over $3,000, with some big-ticket estates recently going for $182,000. Not bad considering the initial land offering price was around $20. Being able to turn twenty bucks into six figures is one of the drivers behind metaverse land investing hype for those who are lucky enough to get in early and pick the winners. Image via While the investment may be worth the risk for many, I do think the excitement and hype about the metaverse tends to cloud the logical judgement of many in the space as so many people fomod in. There is also the question of whether or not metaverse interest will ever again reach the euphoria stage seen in 2021, as interest in the entire NFT, crypto and metaverse space has waned in 2022. Search Trends for NFTs and Metaverse are on the Decline. Image via Investing in virtual real estate is much easier than physical real estate and can be done within minutes. All you need to do is: Then of course, once you have your plot of land you can sit and hodl it or build on it until your hearts content.  The metaverse is a very exciting concept as it is something new that we cannot quite grasp the full potential or limitless nature of. But like every new technological revolution and evolution, this type of investment carries high risk. With so much development and building happening in the space as everyone rushes to become part of what could be a multi-trillion-dollar industry, it is almost guaranteed that many projects will not make it, adding another layer of risk to investors. Much like how over 90% of early internet companies have failed, many metaverse and cryptocurrency companies are likely to follow the same fate. For investors able to stomach the risk and volatility, metaverse and digital land investing offers more opportunities for revenue streams, monetization, and higher ROI potential than what is available with physical real estate. It can also be done significantly more efficiently than physical real estate investing, with clicks of a button done in minutes, instead of mountains of paperwork, red tape, and intermediates overcomplicating a process that can take weeks or months. If you are someone whose whole life is spent online, then increasing your virtual presence and investing in metaverse land could be a logical next step. But for many who still want to participate in real life, and do things like raise a family, have friends over for Sunday BBQs, and things like that, spending thousands on virtual property, and needing to spend hours online to manage your digital investments may not be the best call, especially if you do not have a physical and stable property secured for your real-life adventure game. I am a big fan of those post-apocalyptic and zombie-themed TV shows and books, and I do often find myself questioning my asset acquisition in life. As I mentioned earlier, there is something to be said for the security and safety of your physical self. If all hell breaks loose tomorrow and zombies, invading armies, pirates, bandits, or zombie pirate bandits come strolling into town, I am pretty sure that my Bitcoin and NFTs likely arent going to get me very far, and one cannot seek refuge in a virtual home, so I often feel that it is a good idea to get your physical life sorted and secure before going all-in on speculative fairy tale lands that exist in cyberspaceAlways good to have a fallback plan.

As crypto exchanges , , and  expand operations, and VC firms a16z, Babel Finance, and Huobi Ventures pour billions of dollars into funds that , Tron is the only major network that is showing bullish price behaviour that reflects the behind-the-scenes bullish confidence in the space.

It would appear that  was not enough to dispel crypto enthusiasts desire for an algorithmic stablecoin, as crypto users flood into Tron to utilize another stablecoin that many feel is nothing but a ticking time bomb waiting to follow Terras fate.

35,2022-05-30,"The 8 Best Desktop Wallets in 2022",https://www.coinbureau.com/review/best-crypto-desktop-wallets/," Believe it or not, there are still many out there not spooked by recent market conditions and are doubling down on their efforts, including me. I look at these prices and think: yay, Black Friday sale! After all, the foundation for fortunes comes from bearish times, with the riches reaped during bullish periods. Having bought a bunch of tokens, the next thing to do is hunt for a good wallet to store them in. When it comes to wallet types, there are primarily two types: cold and hot wallets. The former refers to hardware wallets that come in the form of a USB stick and a desktop application as the UI for it. The latter are divided into mobile wallets, browser-extension/web wallets, and desktop wallets. In this article, we are going to focus on the last kind.  Page Contents  [] The easiest way to think about desktop wallets is that they are wallet apps designed for computers. Technically- speaking, there are no mobile versions, so users cant easily access it across multiple devices. However, some wallet developers want to offer users the option of a mobile app if they so desire. My suggestion is that if you choose the desktop version, ignore the mobile app. As inconvenient as it may seem, its also more secure because theres only one way to access it. I would swap convenience for security any day when safeguarding my precious crypto assets. There are a few things to consider when looking to get a desktop wallet. Some of these considerations are based on your purpose for getting the wallet in the first place. Some wallets only support one type of crypto, mainly Bitcoin or Ethereum. Other wallets support every token traded on major exchanges. Unfortunately, this usually doesnt include newer tokens that only get listed in DEXs. When I first came across, I didnt realise until later that its an example of afull nodewallet. Whenever I boot it up to check on my ADA holdings, its downloading a copy of the Cardano blockchain onto my laptop. Unfortunately, the bigger the blockchain got, the longer it took to access the wallet on my poor laptop. Unless you are looking to run a full blockchain node yourself, I would say that a full node wallet isnt something suited for everyone. For example, most of us use our wallets to transfer funds or do some staking. In this case, theSimple Payment Verificationtype would be sufficient to suit our needs. Most wallets in the market are of this type. It verifies that a transaction is in the blockchain without downloading the entire blockchain. Its standard to assume that any desktop wallet worth its salt should at least have seed phrase protection. You are also given a recovery phrase to access your wallet if your computer is stolen or destroyed. Going one step up would be 2FA. Short for Two-Factor Authentication, the two-factor part refers to what you know and what you have. A password is an example of the former, and an Authenticator app like Google Authenticator or Authy is the latter. The app generates a 6-digit code entered in the wallets interface as proof of having something. Some wallets even come with themultisigoption. Short for multi-signature, its not enough for one person to sign a transaction independently. Instead, the number of people established initially all need to sign the transaction to show complete agreeance for the transaction to go through. That way, even if one person is compromised, the funds still cant be moved. As long as something is online, getting hacked is always possible, even if that possibility might be quite low. If the desktop wallet is connected with a hardware wallet, this greatly decreases the risk of stolen funds since it still boils down to what you have. In this case, funds transfer needs to be approved with the USB device that is the cold wallet. Hackers from afar would be unable to get their hands on this device.  Check that the funds you want to protect are in the account or wallet address connected to the hardware wallet. For example, with browser-extension wallets, the connected account is not necessarily the default account, so you will need to transfer funds to the correct account. No matter how secure the desktop wallet is, if the UI is poorly-designed, its not going to have many people using it, which defeats the purpose of its existence in the first place. It needs to have a certain level of intuition that most people can grasp without resorting to watching how-to-use videos on YouTube. When things go wrong, as they sometimes will, reaching out to someone who can look into your problem is a great relief. One of the most common reasons for wanting to talk to customer support is when funds dont show up as expected, especially if you can see that it was a successful transfer on the blockchain explorer. Email support would be the bare minimum. Chat support would be better but dont hold your hopes up for phone support. Unless there is a financial entity behind the wallet, who will pay for the staff to chat with you? Aside from providing a safe space for you to store your funds and allowing you to send and receive funds, some wallets also have other functions like crypto-trading or staking. These wallets integrate with a trading platform so that you can trade while still retaining custody of your funds. Theres also no need to trade on a decentralised exchange which entails going to a different website. However, this is not the cheapest option. I guess thats the price for both convenience and security. Nothing is perfect and expecting anything like that is just an invitation to disappointment. Here are some of the things to watch out for when using desktop wallets: Now that we have covered most of the bases lets get cracking looking at whats available to choose from in the marketplace! Before Satoshi, there was. Or so they would like to claim. In reality, the first  was launched in August 2014., the same year Mt Gox went kaput. Having been around the block, it is one of two top hardware wallets in the industry. Sorry if I have to cheat a bit here by including it in this article, but it has a desktop interface and doesnt come with a mobile version, so lets just let that slide, shall we? The wallet comes with what looks like a fancy car key as the hardware component. This is paired with the desktop app for managing the assets supported by the wallet. The interface is relatively clean and straightforward and supports pretty much any token under the sun. One of the leading industry standards for wallets. Image via Trezor Aside from retail owners, Trezor is also used by many significant enterprises and endorsed by Coindesk, Forbes etc. If these companies trust Trezor to do their job, there is no reason for you and me not to. Trezors no. 1 competitor is, and Im sure the feeling is mutual between them. The company started in 2014, the same year as Trezor and is based in Paris, France. The desktop app, known as Ledger Live, is the interface for their hardware wallet, of which there are three models. Through the app, you can stake, swap assets and even manage your NFTs directly. Unlike Trezor, which needs to rely on a third-party intermediary like Metamask to manage NFTs, you can send, receive and see your NFTs in the Ledger Live app. However, only Ethereum and Polygon-based NFTs are supported currently. Another function in the wallet is that you can buy bitcoin directly in  through their partnership with Coinify and Wyre via credit/debit card. One of the things that always makes me antsy about buying bitcoin is the time it takes to transfer it from wherever to the Ledger wallet (Disclaimer: I own a Ledger wallet). So being able to go from buying to storing in a cold wallet in one shot is as safe as it goes for making a crypto purchase. However, the rates arent always the best as its pretty much a spot purchase, i.e. buying based on market rate and the fees are also something to consider. Robust security and an easy-to-understand interface. Image via Ledger In my early days of getting my feet wet in crypto, that was when I heard about. At the time, I thought all it had was the mobile version. Only much later did I find out that they have a desktop version. Unlike other wallets that simply list Linux as one of the supporting operating systems, they listed specific Linux distro packages such as Fedora, Ubuntu and Debian. That tells you how serious they are when it comes to the business of desktop wallets. Its also a prime example of a wallet providing more than just the basics. Aside from supporting a variety of tokens, they allow users to buy crypto with a regular credit card with a 1% cashback. After purchasing the tokens, you can also earn some juicy staking rewards directly in the wallet. Please note that they only support 13 tokens for staking currently, so check first before you buy if this is what youre interested in. The most unique feature about Atomic that is not found with the other wallets (yet?) is their native token AWC. With a current price of$0.535, it is a BEP-20 token. Earn up to 20% staking the token with Atomic and get 1% cashback for exchanging tokens in the app. Theres even a hint of a referral program coming soon! Theres not as much talk about their security features as some of the wallets do, so while Im sure its as safe as they can make it to be, Id likely only store enough crypto in it as a way of diversification, but that I wont lose sleep over if anything were to happen. A multi-asset wallet that does more than just store tokens. Image via Medium.com/Thorchain One of the most well-known bitcoin wallets, Electrum is a multi-sig wallet with cold storage capability for storing your precious bitcoin. Although it also has a mobile version, were just going to focus on the desktop version for our current purposes. They partner with TrustedCoin in providing the 2FA service. How the multi-sig wallet works is that it has three keys. The user owns two of the three keys, and the third key is in a remote server. A small fee is charged for every transaction using that server. Featuring a no-frills UI and integration with Trezor and Ledger for additional security, this is a basic wallet for all things Bitcoin, including the. When setting up the wallet, you can choose from a series of options. As basic as it comes but gets the job done. Image via Electrum app One of the most popular wallets around, I know quite a number of people who swear by . Its also a top wallet recommended by many in the know, including Investopedia, for beginner users, according to their website. The wallet comes with both a desktop and mobile option but feel free to ignore the latter if you choose the former. Its also integrated with Trezor to provide an extra layer of security. What struck me about the wallet is that it makes full use of the space allocated for a desktop app. Aside from showing the portfolio with key numbers, you can also see the chart for a chosen asset and other useful information. While there is quite a bit of info packed into it, the layout is still pleasing to the eye and, more importantly, not overwhelming. 200+ assets in a colorful yet elegant interface. Image via Exodus Not content with being just a multi-asset wallet supporting more than 200 assets, Exodus also features an exchange within the wallet, allowing for easy swaps between assets without any additional sign-in or navigating to other pages. This is an integration with, giving you access to the exchanges features without signing up for an account with them. Another partnership that benefits users is withby allowing them to earn yield from the DAI in their wallet. Sports-betting is also possible with Exodus, and not just for regular sports such as baseball, basketball etc., but also for E-sports like League of Legends. In the meantime, other apps are in development and will no doubt be unveiled when they are ready. A key selling point of the wallet to newbies is its 24/7 human support. They also have an extensive Knowledge Base section that includes a section on blockchain education so users can learn a bit more about the assets they have. If I were a newbie, I would consider using Exodus.  Every now and then, Id come across certain things that seemed to pop up repeatedly. Thewallet is one of those. Its a wallet under most peoples radar, yet the reviews are mostly positive, as seen on this page from. The wallet is aimed at the mainstream crowd with the following features: The website also features quite a sizeable section on crypto education where one can learn about crypto basics, written in pedestrian language, i.e. language that most people understand. This messaging is consistent with their approach of being the wallet for the everyday Joe. Customers can talk to someone via Live Chat to answer any questions or concerns they may have. At the same time, email support is available during the after-hours period. A wallet for the everyday Joe  Image via Guarda One of the things you might notice as you browse the homepage foris its claim to being the oldest multi-asset wallet. It was established in 2014, which in most cases, being less than a decade old, doesnt seem much, but in crypto-land, where six months is equivalent to 1.2 years in normal speed, that does seem shy of being next to the dinosaurs. It also makes it impressive and maybe suitable for the casual crypto user because it supports a wide range of fiat currencies in more than 20 languages. With versions available for Windows, Mac and Linux, it is one of the wallets on this list that has a decent social presence, with communication channels on Facebook, Twitter, Telegram, Reddit and Instagram, pretty much covering all the major age and gender groups, with TikTok being the only channel they dont have a presence. Additionally, they offer 24/7 live support, undoubtedly music to a beginners ears, as they can expect some handholding when exploring the wallets features. They also feature YouTube tutorials if you prefer to learn by watching than reading. All the reasons to use Coinomi listed in colorful headings. Image via Coinomi Some interesting features of the wallet include: Nice UI to attract some eyeballs. Image via Coinomi Thewallet is another single-asset desktop wallet for storing Bitcoin with cold storage and multi-sig support. They pioneered managing Bitcoin offline with a computer that never touches the internet. Instead, transactions are made with a watching-only wallet, but the private keys themselves are stored in the offline computer. This greatly reduces the attack surface for hackers. The source code for the wallet is open-source and available for audit and views on GitHub. So in the unlikely event the entity behind it goes under, it is still possible to access your funds with a bit of know-how. The website also has a tutorial section on using the wallet for various functions. As it was designed for developers to use, the UI is very basic. But enough to do what needs to be done. When it comes to security, though, its pretty top-of-the-line. Given the opportunity, I wouldnt mind storing my bitcoin in this wallet. For a free wallet, its as good as it gets. A free wallet with top-notch security for your bitcoin. Image via Armory Weve covered some of the more well-known ones available in the market. It is by no means an extensive list but to give you an idea of what is considered standard functionality and what is a unique selling point. Most importantly, its about finding a wallet that fits your needs, and its ok if no single wallet fulfils all of them. In fact, it might not be a bad idea to diversify a bit by having two or even three wallets for your crypto. That way, if anything bad were to happen to one of them, youd still have your assets safe in other wallets. Just dont spread yourself too thin that you cant manage what you own.",coinbureau,coinbureau,Positive,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1

With seemingly endless hacks, exploits, rug pulls, project failures, and , Charles Hoskinson reconfirms his stance on why crypto projects should move slowly and ensure that they get things right the first time, so people stop losing money and confidence in the crypto sector. Charles Hoskinson at a Ted Talk About Why the Future Will be Decentralized. Image via Popular projects such as  and  notably follow this moving fast mantra. The result has been projects and products being quick to market, but experiencing issues that plague the crypto community such as atrociously high network fees, and in the case of Solana, Projects that take a more educational, peer-reviewed, and research-based approach are the likes of  and , who act more like the tortoise than the hare in the fabled race between the two. These projects have come under scrutiny from impatient investors and users as they have been slower in their development and release to market, but with the aim of theoretically producing a more robust network that should see fewer issues than their rushing competitors. In a recent  with Coindesk, Hoskinson pointed out why we need to be more careful stating: If you move too quickly, as weve seen with Luna, and weve seen withlast year, you could actually get it to work until it doesnt, and then when it doesnt its a catastrophic failure and everybody loses their money In contrast, Hoskinson said that he and his company IOG (formerly IOHK) are moving deliberately in building the Cardano network playing the long arc game, measured not in weeks or months, but in years to decades. We always say its not first, its best out of the gate who succeeds, Hoskinson said. The people who are going to survive are those who are tested under stress and exhibit resiliency. Hoskinsons Cardano project is one of the most closely watched in the industry, amassing vast amounts of attention from retail and institutional investors alike partly thanks to Grayscales Smart Contract Platform Fund. Earlier this year, Grayscale launched an Ethereum alternative fund that houses Polkadot, Algorand, and Solana, with the largest weighting going to Cardano at 25.35% Image via Hoskinson is also one of the highly anticipated speakers who will be attending Consensus 2022 in Texas this June.

37,2022-05-30,"Bitcoin and Stocks: Not the Decoupling We Were Hoping For",https://www.coinbureau.com/news/bitcoin-and-stocks-not-the-decoupling-we-were-hoping-for/," Bitcoin has been showing a strong relationship to the stock market in recent months, with a notably strong correlation in performance with the Nasdaq. But last weeks market data suggests that this correlation is weakening and could be coming to an end. For a long time, crypto enthusiasts have been keen to see a decoupling in the relationship between Bitcoin and traditional financial markets so Bitcoin can live up to its potential narrative of being an , , and a useful asset to hold as part of a . Bitcoins performance in recent months has gone hand in hand with the greater stock market, reducing its effectiveness in the mentioned narratives. When stocks are up, BTC price has gone up, and when stocks drop, Bitcoin typically follows suit. A Look at Bitcoin vs the Nasdaq composite index. Image via This past week saw green action across the stock markets, with the Nasdaq up 3.1%, while Bitcoin has fallen 3%, not exactly the sort of decoupling we have been hoping for. The United States Commerce Department released  on May 27th, showing that personal savings rates fell to 4.4% in April, reaching the lowest levels since 2008. This has sparked fear among investors and crypto traders that worsening global macroeconomic conditions could lead to further aversion for capital allocation to risk-on assets, which is how Bitcoin is viewed by many institutional investors. One of Bitcoins strongest narratives that we are yet to see play out is as a viable risk-off asset class, a store of value similar to the likes of Gold that could lead to further inflows of institutional money into the asset. A further decoupling could help drive this narrative to fruition. As institutional investors have been cautiously dipping their toes into the Bitcoin pool, the asset has been largely treated as a risk-on asset, along with tech and speculative growth stocks, which has led to Bitcoin seeing similar buying and selling patterns. Bitcoin holders often argue against the asset being treated as a similar speculative gamble and feel that institutions are failing to see Bitcoins true potential. While one week of data is not enough to make any definite conclusions, this new inverse correlation is interesting to see. It appears that for the past week, for better or for worse, Wall Street agreed with the sentiment that Bitcoin should not be placed in the same basket as other assets.

In  for a testimony to the Committee on Financial Services in Washington, Brainard alluded to the recent  (UST) debacle that wiped out over $50 billion in wealth, and used it as an example of why comprehensive regulation should exist for stablecoins. There has been explosive growth in an emergent digital financial system built around new digital assets and facilitated by crypto-asset platforms and stablecoins as settlement assets, she said. Two widely used stablecoins have come under considerable pressure. One widely used algorithmic stablecoin declined to a small fraction of its purported value, and the stablecoin that is the most traded crypto asset by volume temporarily dipped below its purported one-to-one valuation with the dollar. Image via Shutterstock According to Brainard, these events highlight the need for clear regulator guardrails to provide consumer and investor protection, protect financial stability, and ensure a level playing field for competition and innovation across the financial system. The Fed official said that currently, there may not be an immediate need for a , but that in the future, there could be conditions that may give rise to such a need. We recognize there are risks of not acting, just as there are risks of acting. Brainard suggested that if stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies  what she refers to as private monies  rise to prominence and become widespread, there may be a fragmentation of the US payment system into so-called walled gardens. If and when private money does rise to prominence, Brainard hinted that it could coexist with CBDCs, and the two asset classes could ultimately complement each other. In a way, cryptocurrencies in some nations are already complimenting CBDCs as governments enter a race to digitize their money system. In Norway, Norges Bank has already  a CBDC pilot that runs on an Ethereum layer-2 protocol called Nahmii, stating: We are planning further development projects based on the same technology. The technology will be particularly relevant for collaboration with alliance partners (including banks) and as a basis for a sandbox.

The report, titled Decrypting financial stability risks in crypto-asset markets, while mostly a critique and warning of the industry, does reveal some bullish metrics. For example, the ECB says that based on results from its recent Consumer Expectation Survey (CES) from six larger eurozone countries, as much as 10% of households may own crypto-assets Most crypto-asset owners reported holding less than 5,000 in crypto-assets, with a slight predominance of smaller holdings (below 1,000) in this group, they said. At the other end of the spectrum, around 6% of crypto-asset owners confirmed that they held more than 30,000 in crypto-assets. Looking at the income quintiles of the respondents, the pattern is largely U-shaped: the higher a households income, the more likely it is to hold crypto-assets, with lower-income households more likely to hold crypto than middle-income households.

On the other hand, the ECB says: Crypto-assets lack intrinsic economic value or reference assets, while their frequent use as an instrument of speculation, their high volatility and energy consumption, and their use in financing illicit activities make crypto-assets highly risky instruments. This also raises concerns over money laundering, market integrity and consumer protection, and may have implications for financial stability. The government body reiterated that crypto assets are not suitable for most retail investors, either as an investment or store of value, warning that they could lose a large amount of the money they have invested. The ECB also listed all the usual alleged risks associated with crypto, including misleading information, the absence of rights and protections such as complaints procedures or recourse mechanisms, and product complexity with leverage sometimes embedded.

I do expect it to go down to somewhere between $14k, $18k, maybe $22k as a stable point but remember we have seen this the past two times. This is nothing new right, every time it goes up to an all-time high there is a point when it comes down to and finds the new lower point as a base point to stand around.

I dont know about you, but I grew up on anime and online TCGs. I spent countless hours grinding in Yugioh Duel Links and Hearthstone. And when I got into crypto and blockchain gaming, a couple of the very first games I discovered were Splinterlands and Gods Unchained. With  getting , I decided now would be the best time to write a piece on Splinterlands, one of the most popular TCG games thats successfully survived more than four years in the crypto gaming industry. Bear or Bull Market, this game has managed to hold on. In this article, I try to give you a good idea of what the game is, how to get started, and whether you can make a profitable side hustle from playing competitively. So, without further ado, let us get down to the details. Page Contents  [] Splinterlands is a multiplayer digital-collectible trading card game on the Hive blockchain. The game is a strategic auto-battler, where players must put together the most optimal 7-card deck to fight against their opponents in each round. Each round will begin with its own set of rules upon which the player must create their deck. Its reminiscent of games such as Hearthstone, Legends of Runeterra, Yu-Gi-Oh and Magic the Gathering Arena.  Cards in Splinterlands are player-owned non-fungible tokens. Players can use their NFTs to battle for prizes, collect them as collectibles, trade them on the peer-to-peer market, combine them to level up, or even burn them to get Dark Energy Crystals, Splinterlands official in-game cryptocurrency. Splinterlands follows a play-to-earn model with players winning rewards in the Ranked mode by competing against each other in a league-based system. To progress up the league, players must secure wins and earn rank points. The higher the league, the better rewards players can earn through winning matches. Splinterlands is free-to-try but not free-to-play. Players cannot earn rewards or buy card packs to competitively climb ranks without purchasing the Summoners Spellbook (more on that later). However, the game does allow players to play a few matches and try it for free before deciding to invest in the game. The game was originally launched on the Steem blockchain as Steem Monsters in May 2018 before rebranding to Splinterlands in April 2019. Splinterlands officially migrated to the  after it forked from Steem in 2020. Steem Monsters Banner via Splinterlands was developed by  and , who took inspiration from popular card games such as Magic the Gathering and Hearthstone. The two met in 2018 and were working together to build a marketing platform when they learned they had a common interest in gaming. When Matthew suggested that they start a trading card game, Dr. Reich revealed that he had one almost ready to go. This was the beginning of the game which would be known today as Splinterlands. Splinterlands Team Community Call via Since that April 2018 meeting, the game has been played tens of millions of times, the cards are collectively worth millions of dollars, and players are actively trading with each other on the marketplace. The game has truly become one of the most popular crypto games in the industry. The team behind the game has also expanded manyfold since then, with over  and many collaborators. Currently, Dr Reich handles fundraising, sales, marketing, financials, game development, and community development of Splinterlands while Matthew is the CTO of the project. The team also boasts of high-profile advisors with a rich experience in the field. The projects senior advisor  is a consultant with the United Nations for almost 4 years. He primarily aids the UN with FinTech & Blockchain solutions to help alleviate poverty, support business ecosystems, and improve society at large. Another advisor, Edward Sullivan is currently the CEO and Founder of Trust Exchange. To get started with playing Splinterlands, the first thing you need to do is create an account by signing up. You can do so by going to  or by downloading the app and signing up with your smartphone. You can play Splinterlands on both the browser and mobile device. For mobile, Splinterlands is available on both Android and iOS. Splinterlands Welcome Page After successfully registering, the game will provide you with a basic set of starter cards that are not NFTs. You can use this deck to take the optional tutorial and learn the different mechanics of the game while playing a few practice matches. Now that youve played a few practice matches, you probably want to try climbing up the ranks with your free non-NFT starter deck. Well, I hate to break it to you, but you cant. Well, technically, you can try and maybe win a few matches. But it is virtually impossible to rank up without buying or renting a few cards. And, to be able to buy or rent cards, you need to purchase the Summoners Spellbook from the game. Summoners Spellbook Payment Page Dont worry, its not an actual spellbook but rather a sort of membership pass. Purchasing the spellbook primarily creates an account on the Hive blockchain for you. This way all the NFTs and tokens you accumulate can be safely stored in the wallet. The Summoners Spellbook is a one-time purchase and costs $10. Payment can be made through two channels- either crypto or PayPal. Once youve made this purchase, all of the features of the game such as purchasing cards and using some in-game features will be made available. Starting from May 31st 2022, purchases of Summoners Spellbook will include 3000 Credits which can be used in the in-game shop or to purchase or rent cards from the market. Players can now Now that weve understood how to setup the game, let us take a brief overview into all the components of the game before delving into the gameplay. The cards are the primary component of the game. They can be acquired by purchasing booster packs or by receiving rewards in loot chests at the end of the season. They are also actively traded on Splinterlands own marketplace as well as secondary markets like  (Hive chain) and  (Wax blockchain). Cards can be broadly categorised into three types: summoners, monsters and item & spell cards. Currently, Summoners and Monsters are the primary cards used to play the game. Splinterlands Fire Splint Cards via Each Summoner and monster corresponds to one of seven splinters. Splinters are like elemental factions to which each card belongs. The splinters currently in existence are fire, water, earth, life, death, dragon, and neutral splinters. During the game when a Summoner is chosen, the player will only be able to make a deck with monsters that belong to the same splinter as the summoner. The only two exceptions to this rule are monsters belonging to the neutral splinter and summoners belonging to the dragon splinter. Neutral monsters can be included in any splinter deck. Dragon summoners allow you to use dragon monsters as well as monsters from one other splinter. This could be dragon+fire, or dragon+water, or dragon+any of the other splinters available. Item and Spells Splinterlands Banner via Item and Spell cards are an upcoming feature that will be released with the lands of the Splinterlands game. These cards will not be sold by Splinterlands but instead mined from the land parcels and sold in the secondary markets. Item and Spell cards allow the player to actively influence the outcome of the match by letting the player use the card during the match. This disrupts the current auto battler format of Splinterlands. There are five primary stats on a card- The cards themselves have two different types of rarities. Gold Foil Card via Foil rarity Both summoners and monsters can be regular, or of a gold foil variation. Gold foils are rarer than regular foils, and provide more Collection Power than a regular card. Each gold card also gives a 10% bonus when played in a winning battle. Supply rarity This rarity refers to the number of copies of a particular card in circulation and is split into common, rare, epic and legendary based on the opening percentage in booster packs or Loot chests. The higher the rarity, the more copies of the card are required to level the card up. Cards can be levelled up by combining multiple copies of the same card. Higher-level cards get increased statistics and, often, additional abilities. Cards can use these abilities to trigger a special effect or increase the stats of your own cards or decrease the stats of your opponents cards. A  available in the game can be found on the official Splinterlands website. Splinterlands has an  as well as multiple secondary marketplaces such as ,  and . Players can buy, sell and bid on the built-in marketplace. The marketplace offers easy filtering options so that players can sort through and find the card most suited to their needs. Each card listed on the marketplace has additional information such as the number of cards in circulation as well as the lowest price for that particular card in the market. Rental Market Splinterlands Players can also rent cards rather than buy them via the built-in marketplace. This is possible due to Hive blockchains delegation feature that allows assets to be delegated to other accounts on the blockchain. The rental cards, however, have limitations. For example, they cant be combined, sold, or transferred, but the renter can utilise them in play, and they add to the players total CP. Land in Splinterlands offers owners the ability to mint exclusive items and spell cards. As explained before, these items and spell cards will never be sold by the team but instead produced and traded completely between players. Splinterlands Land on AtomicHub The land sales happened in batches over 2020 and 2021 and have completely sold out. Soon after the primary sales, the gameon the secondary market for over $700,000. Currently, you can purchase land on secondary markets, with the cheapest one selling for around $250 aton the Wax blockchain. Splinterlands also has a guild system where players can band together and use their combined resources to earn additional value, including DEC bonuses and discounts on various Splinterlands purchases. Guilds can be extremely useful to maximise the rewards obtained from the game. Guild members can commit DEC and grow the guild to unlock various benefits for members. In future updates, we can also expect to see brawls between guilds. Brawls are a guild vs guild battle format where members belonging to two different guilds are pitted against each other to earn merits and crowns which are used to upgrade buildings and buy gladiator packs. Now that weve touched upon all the components that make up Splinterlands, lets look at the gameplay, shall we? There are three main battle modes in the game: To earn rewards, players need to competitively battle each other and win in the games ranked mode. Once players have chosen to battle, the game matches the player with another player of the same or similar skill level. This ensures that matchups are fair and equal.  Once the matchup is decided, the screen prompts both players to create a deck of 7 cards comprising one summoner and six monster cards arranged in the sequence of play. Again, strategy and card collecting play a very important role here, as battles in Splinterlands implement an element of randomisation by changing the rules for every battle. In lower leagues, the change in rules typically involves changing the amount of mana provided to players in every battle. Every card has a mana cost that must be paid to place it within a deck. The changing mana limit ensures that players do not repeat or spam the same decks or strategies for every match in the game. Deck Building Phase with 32 Mana Restriction In higher leagues, the change in rules typically involves a mana restriction and disallowing specific summoners, cards or abilities. This added complexity provides a better challenge to the more skilled players of the game. This ensures that the gameplay remains interesting and stimulating while preventing a meta saturation during the season. For the non-gamers, meta in gaming terminology generally refers to the most powerful strategy or card combination currently trending within the TCG game. Players with a broader collection of cards would be able to navigate battles better despite the mana limit or other restrictions in the game. In addition, having a wider variety of cards at hand gives the player more choices in creating a deck, underlining the importance of card collecting within the game. Strategic Gameplay Splinterlands However, just having a wide variety of cards is not enough. Players also need to be strategic due to Splinterlands auto-battler format. This format does not allow players to actively influence the direction of the battle once the deck is made and the battle has begun. Instead, the order of play in which the cards were arranged in the deck and the distribution of stats play a key role, underlining the importance of strategy. Once the decks have been made and confirmed by both players, the battle results are immediately uploaded to the blockchain and players are displayed a live replay of the battle. Though you can skip the replay, I highly recommend watching it as it allows you to learn different strategies and combinations used by your opponents. Splinterlands follows a league-based system for its ranked battles, with six leagues that players can be placed in according to their rating points and Collection Power (CP). As players progress through the Leagues, the rewards increase, but so does the complexity of strategy and the intensity of competition. When a player qualifies for the next League, they have the option to advance or stay in the current League. If they remain in the same League, gaining points will be more difficult because nearly everyone they encounter will have lower League scores than them, but they will be able to compete for the top spot in their current League. The top players on each Leagues leaderboard are awarded booster packs as prizes, apart from their rewards at the end of each season. The six leagues are:  Silver and Gold Leagues Diamond and Champion Leagues The seasons in Splinterlands follow a similar pattern in other online TCG games. Splinterlands seasons range between 12 to 16 days, with the end time of each season being rotated so that players from different regions of the world get to experience that last-minute grind to the leaderboard.  Season Countdown At the end of each season, players are awarded the corresponding Loot Chests to their final league ranking. After the loot chests are given out, the booster packs are distributed to the top 50 leaders in each league. However, be mindful that players need to participate in at least one match to be eligible for season rewards. After all the rewards are distributed, the timer is reset for the next season, and the player is dropped by one league. For players to progress along the leagues, they need to be mindful of two key rating metrics. The first is the players Collection Power (CP), and the second is the players rating points. Collection power is the combined Dark Energy Crystals (DEC  the main in-game currency of the game) burn value of each NFT card owned or leased to you that is in your possession. This excludes the non-NFT starter cards that every player receives when creating an account in the game. So what does that mean? When cards in Splinterlands are burned, they produce a certain amount of DEC received by the player burning the card. The total number of DEC you would receive if you were to burn all the cards in your possession would be your Collection Power. Splinterlands: Chaos Legion Each League has a threshold CP that players need to cross to rank up. This means that you cant rank up unless you own or rent a good number of cards. Players can acquire cards in two ways- either by purchasing individual cards or booster packs in the primary or secondary markets or by renting cards from other players in the markets. The second metric for ranking up is the actual player rating, which players gain through winning games. Each League and its tiers demand a steady increase of 300 rating points per tier to move on to the next one. The only exception to this rule is the Champion league which requires an increase of 500 rating points to move to the next tier. However, gaining rating points isnt easy; every match you lose reduces your rating points. So ideally, players must have at least a consistent 50% win rate to progress smoothly in the leagues. The Splinterlands team hasthat will go into effect from 31st May 2022. The new rewards system will significantly bump up the number of rewards issued to players by incentivising players to play the game and rack up more wins. Ranked Rewards Under the new model, season rewards will be based on the number of reward shares earned from all ranked battle wins during the season. Earlier, only the DEC rewards were influenced by the rewards share system, but now the system will extend to seasonal and daily rewards. Additionally, this means that the bonuses from gold foils and guilds can now be applied to seasonal and daily rewards. There will also be different loot chests, one corresponding to each league (Bronze  Champion), with higher league chests containing significantly more / higher valued rewards. The type of loot chests earned from daily and season rewards will be based on the highest league achieved during the previous season. The new reward share system will also penalize players using the starter cards by negating some reward shares for every starter card in your deck. This is to encourage players to use decks with NFT cards, thereby decreasing the value of starter cards and increasing the value of NFT cards. If youre looking for a more comprehensive analysis of the earnings vs expenditure calculations of the game, I highly recommend givinga read.  Splinterlands has a three token economy comprising of Each of these tokens has its own utility, which plays a vital role in maintaining the games economy. Let us have a look at each of them in better detail. Dark Energy Crystals (DEC) is the official reward token of Splinterlands. It is earned through winning matches in the game. The token is always pegged to maintain the value of 1000 DEC = $1. As a result, the official daily reward pool, which is fixed at 1 million DEC, fluctuates based on the price of DEC. For instance, when the price of 1000 DEC falls below $1, the reward pool size falls below 1 million DEC, and vice versa. Dark Energy Crystals Splinterlands This daily reward pool is split and earned by players at varying rates based on several factors, such as the players current league, the number of players playing on the day, the DEC capture rate, and other active bonuses. To maintain the utility and value of DEC, the token is burnt through various use cases. The most notable, in my opinion, is being the official currency to purchase miniset packs in the game. Each pack in the shop can be purchased with 1000 DEC per dollar, irrespective of whether DEC is trading at $1. If 1000 DEC is worth less than $1, players can purchase the packs at a discount driving up the demand for the token to buy more packs. DEC Price History DEC currently trades at $0.00114 per token, placing it slightly above the $1 peg per 1000 DEC. The token hit an all-time high of $0.016 in October 2021 and an all-time low of 0.00048877 in March 2021. DEC can be bought atand. Credits are similar to DEC; both tokens are pegged to 1000 = $1. However, unlike DEC, Credits are not tradeable on secondary markets. They can only be used to redeem for packs or other items in the Splinterlands marketplace. Credits act as a closed-loop internal currency of the game. Splinterlands has balanced its referral/affiliate system by crediting users with Credits as a part of its commission payout. This prevents mass dumping or gaming of the affiliate system by malicious actors. Each credit earned goes towards purchasing packs or renting cards within the marketplace, promoting a healthy market economy. Players can purchase credits with PayPal or any accepted cryptocurrency. Splintershards Splintershards or SPS is a BEP-20 governance token of Splinterlands. The SPS token holders can stake their SPS to vote on the proposal put forward by the DAO. Each staked SPS token will be worth one vote, meaning the more SPS tokens a person holds, the greater influence they will have over the voting results. Additionally, anyone can submit a governance proposal for voting as long as they pay a price in SPS tokens that will be burned. SPS has a total supply of 3 billion tokens with a steady release schedule that lasts for approximately 65 months from when the token first launched. The token supply was allocated in the following manner: Splinterlands is also launching validator nodes to allow the community to validate transactions within the game and earn SPS for doing so. These validator nodes will be used to secure the DAO governance on the Hive blockchain. Validator nodes will follow a delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) consensus model which will allow even people without a node to delegate their SPS to a validator and take a share in the block rewards. The SPS validator software will be 100% open source and available for anyone to download and run without any costs or restrictions. Results of Splinterlands Validator Node License Sales as of Day 2 In order to further incentivize a larger participation in the validation process and further decentralize the application, the Splinterlands team has introduced the concept of Validator Licenses. Holders of Licenses are guaranteed a share of the monthly SPS rewards as long as they run an active node. This means that instead of the usual 100-150 validators winning block rewards in DPoS chains, a far greater number of validators will share SPS rewards in Splinterlands validation process. Node Operators can also hold multiple validator licenses on a single node and enjoy additional rewards from all of them. In terms of Rewards, there are 3,750,000 SPS tokens per month allocated to a reward pool for SPS Validator Node operators. 10% will be devoted to block validation rewards (375,000), and the remaining 3,375,000 SPS / month will be split equally between all of the license holders that are actively running the node software. Currently, the validator node licenses are up for sale on the official Splinterlands website. The licenses seem to be selling out quite well as the pre-sale sold out all 2000 licenses within the first 10 minutes. At the time of writing, the sale is in tranche 1 with over 315 licenses sold. SPS Price History The SPS token is currently trading at $0.08 with an all time high of $1.07 on July of 2021 and an all-time low of $0.05 in May of 2022. The tokens current price is close to its all time lows. SPS can be bought at , ,  and . SPS can be staked on the official Splinterlands website. However, once staked, SPS tokens are subject to an unstaking period of 4 weeks. The tokens will be released into the liquid supply at a rate of 1/4 per week for 4 weeks. Players receive SPS rewards for staking SPS. 2022 Roadmap Splinterlands via One of the more immediate features players can expect in Q2 of this year happens to be the modified version of the ranked mode. With the successful release and sale of the chaos packs, there are now far more sets of cards in the ecosystem that newer players might not be able to collect or compete with some of the older, rarer cards. Splinterlands is launching the Modern and Wild ranked formats to deal with this. The modern format will be more friendly to newer players as it restricts the number of playable cards to the latest two sets- Chaos and Untamed. On the other hand, the wild format is more diverse and will allow players to use any card from any set or edition. The launch of the SPS validator node is also another feature to look forward to, as players can now actively earn SPS and have a greater degree of control in the direction of the game. The introduction of lands and the release of items and spell cards is another feature that I find the most tempting. While I love the gameplay of Splinterlands, I wouldnt mind a bit more control and strategy during the battle. The introduction of the item and spell cards makes this possible. TCGs have always held a special place in my heart, and Splinterlands is currently one of the best in the blockchain gaming space. However, it did take me a couple of tries before getting the hang of the game. While the gameplay is fairly simple to understand, the competition gets quite intense in the higher leagues. To compete at the top level, you require quite a number of cards to rank up and qualify. The game could burn a nice hole in your pocket if you are not deliberate in your card purchases or rentals. The calculations for the play to earn mechanics can be a little confusing for new players, but thankfully the Splinterlands community has a good number of content creators who make the journey easier for fresh players. I highly recommend checking outYouTube channel if youre a new player looking for some helpful tips. If youve managed to stick around till the end of this long article, its safe to say that Splinterlands has caught your interest. So what are you waiting for?

The bitcoin price has fallen to lows not seen since last summer, hovering around $30,000 per bitcoin. Ethereum and smaller cryptocurrencies BNB  , solana, cardano, XRP  , tron and avalanche have been hit even harder by the sell-off with the ethereum price down more than 60% from its all-time highs. Now, as the Fed pushes ahead with its inflation-busting interest rate hikes and a balance sheet reduction program, one closely-watched crypto analyst has predicted bitcoin will be  one of the best assets on the planet  once risk assets begin to recover and the Fed turns dovish. PROMOTED   Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has said he'll back interest rate increases until inflation ... [+] levels off, with traders fearful a hawkish Fed will continue to weigh on the price of bitcoin, ethereum, BNB, solana, cardano, XRP, tron, avalanche and other cryptocurrencies.  I think some of the best assets will be gold, U.S. long bonds, and bitcoin,  Bloomberg Intelligence senior commodity strategist Mike McGlone told , reiterating his bitcoin price prediction of $100,000 by 2025.  The great reversion is just getting started.  Despite bitcoin potentially heading lower in the short term, McGlone said he expects the bitcoin price and the ethereum price to  outperform  eventually.  Right now I fully expect bitcoin to trade lower. I don't' know how much lower But what I fully expect is that when we see the foundation form, which is going to happen, bitcoin and ethereum should come out ahead because they've outperformed for so long.  The Fed said at the tail end of last year it would begin raising interest rates to combat persistently higher inflation than it had anticipated. Inflation eased slightly to 8.3% in April but remains at multi-decade highs. The threat of higher interest rates which had been cut to historic lows through the Covid-19 pandemic sparked an ongoing stock market and crypto sell-off, with technology companies that had soared through the pandemic era leading the declines.  Federal Reserve rate hikes are addressing the need for inflation and risk assets to decline and once things stabilize, we see bitcoin coming out ahead,  McGlone wrote in a note this week.  The bitcoin price has swung wildly over the last year, soaring to almost $70,000 before crashing ... [+] back to around $30,000. Ethereum and other major coins BNB, XRP, solana, cardano, tron and avalanche have seen similar swings. This week, billionaire investor Ray Dalio said he expects the Fed and central banks around the world to begin again cutting interest rates as soon as 2024 due to stagflation a combination of high inflation and low growth hitting the global economy.  We are in a tightening mode that can cause corrections or downward moves to many financial assets,  Dalio, the founder and co-CIO of Bridgewater Associates, told the .

The BNB price has soared 300-fold, giving it a market capitalization of over $18 billion. The massive rally has been helped by a huge increase in both the bitcoin price and the ethereum price since late 2020  Now, after it emerged BNB is reportedly the subject of a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) probe into whether Binance broke securities rules by selling BNB, one bitcoin and crypto exchange expert has warned over  potential conflicts of interest and market fairness issues  at Binance. PROMOTED   Bitcoin and crypto exchange Binance's BNB, a rival to ethereum, has seen its price soar over the ... [+] last few years.  The very object of the SEC investigation, Binance's BNB, is a prime example of potential conflicts of interest and market fairness issues,  Zoltan Kormanyos, general counsel at international broker comparison website BrokerChooser, said in emailed comments, adding the SEC probe  reinforces the trend  the comparison site identified in its  into bitcoin and crypto exchanges. Kormanyos argues crypto exchanges use fundraising and trading products similar to traditional finance while claiming they should be treated differently by regulators. Since the 2017 initial coin offering (ICO) boom, which saw a flood of companies look to raise money by issuing cryptocurrencies, the SEC has brought dozens of enforcement actions over ICOs. The probe into Binance and BNB is likely months away from any conclusion, a person familiar with the matter told . News of the investigation sparked a 10% drop in the BNB price, which has since slightly rebounded. Binance's BNB white paper, published ahead of its launch, said 85% of the funds raised in the ICO would be used to build and promote the Binance platform. Binance traders using BNB to pay fees get a discount on the exchange.  The BNB price has rocketed higher since its launch in 2017, surging along with the bitcoin and ...

Whilst the SEC investigates Binance all eyes are now on the brand themselves who seem to be lacking transparency across entities as it is unclear how Binance is related to other brands falling under the same umbrella,  Kormanyos said, pointing to a myriad of legal and regulatory challenges faced by Binance over the last year and the relationship between Binance and its U.S. affiliate BinanceUS. The BNB price has crashed along with bitcoin, ethereum and other major cryptocurrencies in recent months, losing more than half its value since late last year. In late 2020, the SEC sued crypto company Ripple, alleging it broke securities rules when it sold its XRP   cryptocurrency, crashing the XRP price. Ripple remains locked in a long-running legal battle with the SEC though the price of XRP has recovered. This week, Binance was also hit by accusations it was the vehicle for the laundering of at least $2.35 billion in illicit funds. published a report that analyzed court records, spoke with law enforcement, and worked with blockchain analysis firms Chainalysis and Crystal Blockchain to track illicit funds on Binance, claiming the exchange has become a  hub for hackers, fraudsters and drug traffickers.

Bitcoin investors have reason to be cheerful after the cryptocurrency has snapped the longest weekly downtrend in its history,  Nigel Green, the chief executive of financial advisory group deVere, said in emailed comments, pointing to bitcoin's correlation to the stock market as one reason for bullishness. The bitcoin price first began falling late last year after the Federal Reserve announced it would begin to curtail its huge asset purchases and hike interest rates, dropping along with many high-risk tech stocks that had soared through the pandemic era.  I believe that well soon see a bull run that will lead to a significant bounce in the fourth quarter of the year for the worlds leading digital currency. Bitcoin will benefit from a stock market rally as investors move back into riskier assets.  Elsewhere, ethereum's long-awaited Merge upgrade that's set for August and will see ethereum transition from the energy-intensive proof-of-work consensus mechanism used by bitcoin to proof-of-stake is causing concern for some in the crypto industry. The upgrade is also designed to help ethereum scale and reduce its eye-watering transaction fees. Staking cryptocurrencies involves committing them to support a blockchain network and confirm transactions. The Merge upgrade would see ethereum  miners  replaced by  stakers.   Ethereum is in trouble and we don't see a quick way out,  Martin Hiesboeck, head of blockchain and crypto research at trading platform Uphold, said via email, pointing to the growing number of decentralized finance (DeFi) hacks that are happening on the ethereum network as one cause for concern.

The bill, in the works for months, is expected to define whether different cryptocurrencies are either securities or commodities and which agency will have oversight of them either the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or the Commodity Future Trading Commission (CFTC). Last month, The Block  some in the crypto community have expressed concern that the bill could label many cryptocurrencies potentially including the likes of ethereum, BNB, solana, cardano, XRP, tron and avalanche as securities. at a Heritage Foundation event last week, Lummis outlined what the bill will include.  It is a very comprehensive bill, it will be filed on June 7,  Lummis said.  It includes coins that are commodities, coins that are securities, it includes stablecoins, it includes a discussion about CBDCs [central bank digital currencies], consistent with what we heard earlier and a small nod to NFTs [non-fungbile tokens]. Stablecoins, designed to be pegged one-to-one with traditional currencies, CBDCs, and NFTs have all been propelled to the forefront of the regulatory agenda in recent months. The complete collapse of the terraUSD stablecoin and its support coin luna in May sent shockwaves through the bitcoin and crypto market, sparking fears other areas of the crypto ecosystem could also falter.

The ethereum price has seen even sharper falls while other top ten cryptocurrencies BNB, XRP, solana, cardano and dogecoin have cratered (). Now, billionaire bitcoin twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss have been forced to lay off 10% of the workforce at their Gemini crypto exchange warning the market has entered a  contraction phase  known as  crypto winter.    The bitcoin price has lost more than 50% over the last six months, plunging major coins ethereum, ... [+] BNB, XRP, cardano and solana into a brutal crypto winter.  The crypto revolution is well underway and its impact will continue to be profound,  the twins wrote in  to staff.  But its trajectory has been anything but gradual or predictable. Its path can best be described as punctuated equilibrium periods of equilibrium or stasis that are punctuated by dramatic moments of hypergrowth, followed by sharp contractions that settle down to a new equilibrium that is higher than the one before. This is where we are now, in the contraction phase that is settling into a period of stasis what our industry refers to as 'crypto winter.'  The crypto price crash has wiped more than $1.5 trillion worth of value from the combined crypto market in recent months as price of bitcoin, ethereum and other cryptocurrencies plummet in the face of an increasingly hawkish Federal Reserve, the economic fallout from Russia's war in Ukraine and continued supply chain issues in China. The twins wrote the  turbulent market conditions that are likely to persist for some time.  Following bitcoin's huge 2017 rally, the market went into a multi-year period of contraction, with the bitcoin price losing almost 90% of its value before beginning to rebound. Other smaller cryptocurrencies saw even sharper declines and many have never recovered. The Winklevoss brothers, who are also known for their early involvement in the creation of Facebook, are thought to have lost around 40% of their fortunes this year, according to a report by  last month.

55,2022-06-06,"Terra investors in India lost big",https://www.moneyweb.co.za/moneyweb-crypto/terra-investors-in-india-lost-big/," Terra investors around the world lost billions of dollars when the algorithmic-stablecoin project crashed but they recovered a small part of their bets when a new token was distributed as compensation. Investors in India arent as fortunate. Because the countrys tax system is punitive to crypto investing, TerraUSD and Luna token holders who got the new coin  known as Luna 2.0  in a so-called airdrop face a double whammy. They could be taxed as much as 30% of the value of tokens received and they wont be able to offset any gains in the new token against losses from the previous one, tax experts said. Under the new crypto tax regime, effective April 1, any income from the transfer of a virtual digital asset will be taxed at a flat rate of 30%. It does not explicitly mention how airdrops should be taxed, but Jay Sayta, a technology and gaming lawyer, and Manhar Garegrat, executive director of policy at crypto exchange CoinDCX, said the distributions can be seen as income and are subject to the tax. The wordings in the law are so vague, including the definition of virtual digital asset and the definition of transfer, that it would be open to litigation of challenge by the tax department, said Sayta. They normally consider the most aggressive view possible with a view to collecting higher taxes, notwithstanding the fact that such a view may result in absurdity. There were over 160 000 investors that held Luna on the exchange on May 9 and by May 15 the number grew by 77% in India, according to Rajagopal Menon, vice president at Binance-owned WazirX. Its unclear how many more investors held TerraUSD. The increase can be attributed to a surge in buyers post 9th May where the buyer-to-seller ratio was 5:1. In terms of the volumes, 11th and 12th May saw the highest volumes in Luna  53 million USDT combined for both days, Menon wrote in an email. Anoush Bhasin, founder of crypto asset tax advisory firm Quagmire Consulting, said that the Luna 2.0 airdrops may fit into the existing definition of gifts so a flat 30% tax may not apply but gifts are taxed based on a taxpayers income range, or slab rate. Whether considered as a gift or income from crypto, experts Bloomberg spoke to said that under the new tax regime there will be two stages of taxation. First, at the time of receiving the airdrop, a gift tax or a flat 30% tax, will be levied based on the valuation of tokens at time of credit. Second, if the tokens are sold, a flat 30% tax will be applied on the incremental income earned regardless how the tokens are categorized, if the tokens rose in value. There could be a scenario where people have received tokens above INR50 000 and if its treated as gift, youll have to pay taxes on it, but by the time they sell it if the price falls then youll actually realize lesser money, and you may actually go more out of pocket in paying taxes than what you recover and that is the worst case scenario for them as Luna 2.0 was actually issued to compensate, said Meyyappan Nagappan, leader, digital tax at Nishith Desai Associates. Luna 2.0 started trading on May 28 and as of June 3 at 2 p.m., US East Coast time, it was trading at $6.59, down 9% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinGecko and Huobi Global. The quandary is reflective of an Indian government thats long had an uneasy relationship with crypto. The tax structure unveiled this year treats digital assets unfavorably compared with stocks and bonds, leading to warnings of a crypto exodus. Trading has withered as a government-backed payment network was made unavailable to cryptocurrency exchanges, leaving clients unable to fund their accounts with rupees. Why Token Airdrops An airdrop is a way of sending a token directly to wallets and can be used for various purposes. Airdrops are a common tool for early-stage crypto projects to attract users by offering free tokens and can be used to reward early adopters. Airdrops are a way of showing gratitude, said Harsh Rajat, co-founder of Ethereum Push Notification Service or EPNS, which airdropped its native token PUSH to early adopters and those who donated to the project last year. In web3 the concept is that this is made by the people and for the people, if people are testing out a protocol, spending their time then you should be rewarded some rights to the protocol either through governance or utility of token and thats why airdrops exists. In the case of Terra, backer Terraform Labs used an airdrop to compensate investors and revive its project after the stablecoin collapsed, sending the value of sister token Luna spiraling to near zero, wiping out billions of dollars of wealth. Terraform Labs used a snapshot of the old blockchain, now known as Terra Classic, to determine which user wallets should receive Luna 2.0, and how much. Rajat said that global projects wont stop giving airdrops but they will find it difficult to do them in India since crypto investors there may stand to lose a lot of money. Airdrops attract a lot of users, it generates a lot of noise, Rajat said. Sometimes you will be able to recover the tax, sometimes you wont be able to.","Sidhartha Shukla, Bloomberg",moneyweb,Neutral,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1

Each month, on a first-come first-served basis, the Time Capsule Collection offers ultra-limited editions of Prada products. Theyre only on sale for 24 hours, with purchases delivered straight to customers doors. For the new June edition, theres . Those who buy one of only 100 black and white button-down shirts by Cassius Hirst, son of renowned British artist Damien, will receive an NFT (non-fungible token) as part of the experience. They are GIFs of the black and white capsules that Prada uses to brand these events, and theyre also being made available to purchasers of previous editions. It is the latest example of how top brands are experimenting with NFTs to add another dimension to their businesses. This has recently included everything from Nike digital sneakers to virtual collectables from sport clubs such as AC Milan. For example,  a digital bag for more than its real-world equivalent (US$4 115 vs US$3 400), in a sign that the Prada NFTs could fetch a high price if they are resold. Most of the media coverage around NFTs has focused on big art auctions such as , a giant digital collage that sold for US$69 million, and the heavily hyped , 10 000 cartoon avatars of primates looking, well, bored. But clearly, the arrival of traditional brands is also a major part of the story. Total NFT sales for 2022 are heading for , more than double 2021 despite the fact that markets are sinking right now. So what are the best examples of brands operating in this space, and are there pitfalls?  NFTs are online assets that double as certificates of ownership, usually of digital items such as a piece or art or a video, but potentially even physical things like an item of clothing or a car. People can buy and sell NFTs on marketplaces including ,  or , and the  in 2021 on the back of the Beeple hype and leading celebrities like Snoop Dogg and Lebron James issuing NFTs of their own. Sport associations such as  and  were among the early movers, selling NFTs of collectable cards of sporting heroes, videos of classic moments, and even jerseys autographed by players. This is all about using NFTs to capitalise on a loyal fan base by offering them rare assets. In the coming years, NFTs are likely to meld with the virtual worlds of the metaverse, in the sense that many will probably be usable there. Balenciaga, another luxury fashion house, has been an early pioneer in this direction, offering a collection of NFT accessories for gamers to . Nike has been particularly forward-thinking, buying NFT pioneer  late in 2021. RTFKT made its name with a collection of Manga-style 3D NFT characters called  that now trade for tens of thousands of US dollars. In keeping with other top NFT collections like the Bored Apes, RTFKT is using the CloneX characters to craft a storyline that is gradually unfolding over time. In February, CloneX owners were airdropped NFTs of mystery digital boxes . The Mnlths had Nike swooshes on the side and quickly started selling for upwards of US$10,000 (7,944) on NFT marketplaces, even though nobody knew what they contained. In April, Nike announced that owners could burn them to unlock a pair of digital sneakers known as , plus a vial that allows users to customise them, and another mystery box called Mnlth 2. A pair of CryptoKicks has since reportedly sold . Meanwhile, online platforms are helping to make these NFTs more usable.  features for Facebook and Instagram that will make it possible for users to create NFTs and showcase them on their social media profiles.  on something similar, with a view to creating new revenue streams for artists and record companies. But if these are examples of NFTs potential for major brands, there are also serious risks. The market has  in both prices and volumes in recent weeks in line with drops in everything from the stock market to cryptocurrencies. Many collectors will be sitting on assets that were worth a lot more several months ago. A historic sports club like, say, Real Madrid might unintentionally end up undermining its fans financial well-being as a result. Should the club compensate these people in some way to avoid jeopardising the relationship? Or what if the fans become like day traders, flipping NFTs to try and make money. Is the club then vulnerable to being accused of enabling something close to gambling? Another danger is undesirable repercussions from a company giving control of assets to unknown third parties. How would, say, fashion label Patagonias customers feel about its sustainable and activist values if its NFTs ended up being flaunted by a major entrepreneur in fossil fuels? For many brands its also not yet clear whether NFTs could cannibalise the sales of their physical products. Equally, not all brands have the same scarcity value of a Prada or Gucci. A budget retailer such as Primark might experience a lack of demand if it launched NFTs, and its image could be harmed as a result. Companies launching NFTs are going to potentially need to change more than it first appears. They will need to set up a range of new roles to manage relationships with NFT owners and their corporate reputation. This could become a distraction from the companys core business. Perhaps they become like an investment house, more focused on maximising the sales of NFTs than creating value for their customers. Especially for brands with a more progressive culture such as Ben & Jerrys or Oatly, that could raise awkward ethical issues. Nonetheless, its going to be fascinating to see how this market develops. The companies that succeed will probably be the ones that are alert to these risks, and view NFTs as a new revenue market to explore rather than a short-term opportunity. , Associate professor, This article is republished from  under a Creative Commons license.

57,2022-06-04,"Crypto gaming is sold with promise of convenience and riches.",https://www.moneyweb.co.za/moneyweb-crypto/crypto-gaming-is-sold-with-promise-of-convenience-and-riches/," Video games are increasingly incorporating blockchains, the decentralised databases that underpin cryptocurrencies, as well as NFTs and other digital assets. New games are emerging expressly to support blockchain technology, while traditional games are being updated to incorporate blockchains. As of October 2021, crypto gaming accounted for more than half of the blockchain activity over that . At the same time, a  has led to consumer groups calling for regulation in the crypto market. Crypto evangelists say , and crypto gaming is ushering in Web3  the so-called next iteration of the internet built on blockchain technology. How true are these promises?  The advent of crypto gaming roughly coincides with the rise of the Ethereum blockchain, launched in 2015. Ethereum emerged as a platform for building and hosting of decentralised apps (applications designed to run on a blockchain, rather than a singularly owned computer network), as well as ownership over digital assets within those apps. Video games have a history of sophisticated . Games such as World of Warcraft and EVE Online  where items are bought and sold for virtual currencies  became a popular test case for these Ethereum features.  A common model in crypto games is to include two types of crypto tokens. One is a governance token, which generally allows players a say in the governance of a game, and in some instances a share in its revenue. The other is a utility token, which is used to perform certain actions within the game. Game assets (such as a sword or an e-sports trading card) can also take the form of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), with each unique token represented on the blockchain. Its common for NFTs and governance tokens to double as speculative assets that can be bought and sold across crypto or NFT exchanges. But its questionable whether they have any fundamental value. Many gaming tokens are at best  and at worst worthless. Yet proponents of crypto gaming try to sell it as the future. Take crypto venture capitalist and Reddit cofounder Alexis Ohanian, who  crypto gaming will allow players to actually earn value through accruing assets that have some value in traditional or fiat money. In essence, he says people would no longer need to waste time gaming for leisure. Crypto gaming advocates often dont understand why one might play games for no reason other than to have fun or unwind (or myriad other ). In the crypto gaming vision, play becomes the act of seeking valuable tokens, and extending the game into a 24/7 market that pressures players to constantly seek profit. This marketisation of all activity is the very thing that has turned so many off of crypto gaming, and . The notion of retaining value is also framed in terms of developers and audiences being better remunerated for making and playing games. On game-distribution platforms such as , developers deposit a given amount of the platforms cryptocurrency in exchange for having their game hosted. But its difficult to see how this differs from the current model, in which distributors charge a flat fee. In fact, hosting in exchange for cryptocurrency is arguably more problematic when you consider that token prices are subject to volatility. Some people, including Web3 advocate Greg Isenberg, believe blockchain-enabled games might redistribute some of the revenue generated by game companies to players. Players create value for these companies through practices such as  (which refers to modifications, and other in-game activities), and even by contributing to a games . Isenberg and others claim blockchains would provide a reliable record of players contributions, and therefore help set up a base for remuneration.  An increasingly common pitch from blockchain game projects is if tokens are valuable, then play itself can become a form of work. Players can play to earn (commonly referred to as P2E). The best known example is Axie Infinity, a Pokmon-style game where playing yields tokens that () had a high monetary value. In one  on P2E games (hosted by the venture capital fund Andreesen Horowitz, which has invested heavily in them), Gabby Dizon, the co-founder of a P2E gaming guild, claimed P2E was a way to escape  economic hardship. Like the gig economy, P2E promises convenience, flexibility and prosperity at a time of widespread immiseration. Also like the gig economy, its deeply exploitative in practice. As , Axie and other companies like it have a setup in which players must buy an expensive NFT before they can even start playing and participating in the P2E model. A popular business tactic among some wealthy investors is to lease out their Axies (which are linked to NFTs) and take a cut of any money made by players, many of whom are from developing countries such as the Philippines. The result? All but the best players end up earning .  Some traditional game developers have embraced blockchains. Last year, French gaming giant Ubisoft launched its own crypto gaming platform called . Others have been reluctant. Big distributors including  have rejected blockchains, whereas Epic Games has embraced them under . Many indie game developers have , saying blockchains (and particularly NFTs) are scams that have a disastrous environmental impact, and which exacerbate the negative effects of capitalism. A crash in the crypto market  has seen most  lose value. Yet this hasnt deterred . More importantly, ups and downs in the crypto market dont affect the fundamental problems in the value proposition of crypto gaming. While blockchains and Web3  viewed as an investment opportunity by large tech companies and investment funds, ordinary people continue to get  out of their money.

58,2022-06-03,"Jump report shows big investors exited Terra while retail bought",https://www.moneyweb.co.za/moneyweb-crypto/jump-report-shows-big-investors-exited-terra-while-retail-bought/," Jump Crypto, a firm heavily involved in the defunct Terra blockchain, said that some large investors exited Terra-related positions as the TerraUSD (UST) stablecoin began to lose its peg, while small investors continued buying during the collapse. That detail was part of a report on Terras meltdown in early May that Jump Crypto, the crypto unit of Chicago-based Jump Trading, published on Thursday. Until now, the firm has largely remained silent about Terras demise  including how Terras backer, Luna Foundation Guard, allocates its remaining funds to compensate users of UST, or steps the firm took in a failed effort restore the coins 1-to-1 peg to the dollar. While Jumps president, Kanav Kariya, is listed on the foundations website as a member of its governing council, the report does not discuss his firms role in the stablecoin drama. But the findings, based on publicly available blockchain transactions  excluding internal data at Jump  indicates that several large investors exited their position in UST much earlier than many smaller ones, another example of how cryptocurrency remains a game for large professional players. UST, a stablecoin that ran on the Terra blockchain (now Terra Classic), was designed to maintain its dollar peg through both algorithms and trading incentives involving another token, Luna. The growth of Terra exploded over the past two years among both large and mom-and-pop investors, thanks to its quasi-bank, Anchor, which promised 20% interest rates for depositors of UST at some point. But a chain of events triggered a death spiral that sent both UST and Lunas prices down to virtual zero, shocking the crypto market and raising questions about its viability. The crash triggered a broader shock and billions of dollars vanished in just a few days. Jump Crypto acknowledged findings in an earlier report by Nansen, a blockchain analytics platform, that a handful of wallets including one associated with crypto lender Celsius were critical as the dollar peg slipped, leading to an unraveling of the entire blockchain. The Jump Crypto report, written by Nihar Shah and Maher Latif, both researchers, points out that while some large depositors of UST got out of Anchor as early as of May 7, some small depositors, increased their exposure between May 7 and May 9. The outflows of UST from Anchor played a key role in stripping UST away from its peg further, according to Jump. Large depositors were able to run down almost 15% of their UST position in Anchor almost immediately when the dollar-peg slip first took place on May 6, while small depositors, or wallets with less than $10,000 in Anchor as of May 6, increased their exposure. However, their total position size was an order-of-magnitude smaller than that of mid-sized and large depositors, and so this increased exposure was insufficient to counteract the outflows, the report concluded. Jump considers it unlikely that thewalletthat helped touch off the meltdown was associated with a professional trading entity, based on analysis of the wallets history. On May 7, the mysterious wallet reduced its UST position through a series of transactions by about $85 million, a move that the crypto market has concluded was the first in a series of events that triggered the larger disaster. Citadel Securities and BlackRock Inc. said in Maythat they had nothing to do withTerras downfall, after many on social media started speculating who was responsible of the event. 2022Bloomberg L.P.

59,2022-06-03,"Whats the deal with NFTs?",https://www.moneyweb.co.za/moneyweb-podcasts/money-savvy/whats-the-deal-with-nfts/,"  Welcome to the Money Savvy podcast. Im Boitumelo Ntsoko. Non-fungible tokens or NFTs as theyre popularly known seem to be all the rage right now. According to recent data from market tracker DappRadar, NFT sales volumes totalled $24.9 billion [around R386 billion] in 2021, compared to just $94.9 million the year before. But what exactly are NFTs and are they worth the hype? Francois le Clus, who is an independent financial advisor at Attooh! Financial Wellness, joins us on this episode to shed some light on this asset class.Welcome, Francois. : Hi, Tumi, thank you so much for having me. For those of us who are not familiar with NFTs, can you please explain what they are and how they work? : Basically NFT is an abbreviation for a non-fungible token. Now, this sounds a lot more complicated than its actually supposed to be. Let me just quickly break it down for you. Obviously, we all know what non means, but fungible  thats where you sort of lose people. So [does] the fungible basically mean it is something replaceable or replicable? The token is the asset. So what this means is a non-replicable or [non-]replaceable asset that youre trying to buy. How are these tokens different from cryptocurrencies? : You can see these tokens basically as an asset. They take the form of art or a video or a song, but what you do is you buy these assets with cryptocurrencies. The very, very important thing to understand is this asset that youre buying has actually got an underpin of a cryptocurrency. So, as the cryptocurrency fluctuates, the price will also fluctuate. What role can they play in your investment portfolio? : These are highly speculative assets, so need to be addressed as such. Your chance of making a profit or losing some or all of your capital is basically 50:50. Well, thats according to me and what Ive seen. You must always remember: do not invest what you are not supposed to lose, or that you cannot [afford to] lose. So dont go and take a second mortgage out on your home or anything like that to buy these NFTs because you might get it wrong and you could lose it all or a lot of it. For those who are keen on buying NFTs, how can they do so? : It all starts off with buying cryptocurrency. So how you do that is you just open up a wallet. You can do that with Coinbase or Luno; there are loads of wallets out there. You can buy them with your debit card, credit card, or you can transfer your money over to the wallet. And then you can just buy cryptocurrencies. Now, the cryptocurrency that you need to buy is Ethereum or Solana; mostly its Ethereum that you use. From there you will register yourself a portfolio on OpenSea, which is the biggest NFT seller out there. You just link your wallet, and from there you can start transacting and start buying these NFTs. What is the average sale price of an NFT? : Its actually very, very interesting. Before all the hype, NFTs used to go for about $150. Now at the end of 2021, they averaged about $4000. From the end of 2021 until now theres been a little bit of a drop, about a 50% drop in the price of the average NFTs, and they go for about $2000. So theyve taken a little bit of a hit over the past six months or so. Its very, very interesting  the artwork The Merge, which is an NFT, sold for $92million, which is huge. How can I, as an investor, tell if an NFT is worth buying or investing in? : Okay. Some may say that they know, but in my opinion  I dont honestly know. So NFTs are mostly driven by hype and demand. Some NFTs are created by well-known or famous artists, and I could imagine them being investible. There are NFTs that are held by famous people, and I would imagine that people would like to purchase these NFTs just to have bragging rights in the future to say Well, I own the item that this artist used to have or I have the item this famous person used to have. So its highly speculative, and it remains art. And what risk should investors be aware of before investing in these? : Well, obviously theres the risk of not making a return on your investment and losing some or all of your capital. Youll also see if you go onto the OpenSea platform that this is an auctioning system. What theyve seen is a user scheme called wash trading. So the seller takes on the roles of both the buyer and the seller, and then they just push prices up, and they push prices up. Then youve got a buyer on the outside, having the fear of missing out and thinking well, this asset is really popular, everybody wants it and this pushes up the price  I need to buy this. And at the end of the day, you are sitting there with an NFT thats been pumped up; the price has just been pumped up and you are sitting with the short end of the stick and you cant recoup what youve paid for it. Francois, in your opinion, would you say NFTs are worth buying? : Well, Tumi, I dont know enough about art  and thats basically what NFTs are. If you do know something about art, and good art at that, I think its worth having a look at. Art is evolving and its changing at a very rapid pace, and maybe one of these artworks will be the future Mona Lisa [by Leonardo da Vinci] or The Starry Night [by Vincent van Gogh].

Mukheli uses The Tree, an online marketplace for South African artists to promote and sell their art as non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Theres a virtual world where people are buying land in it, said Mukheli, referring to the metaverse, a three-dimensional digital reality that tech giants like Microsoft and Facebook say is the future of the internet. People have properties there  and your art can be on those walls. Mukhelis customers receive both the actual canvas and the NFT, while other artists on The Tree sell up to five limited edition NFTs for each piece, akin to digital prints. Mukheli has already made thousands of dollars by using the platform. I think its important as an artist and a creative to always play where the ball is going and not necessarily where its at, said Trevor Stuurman, one of the four other artists currently showcasing their work on The Tree. Critics say blockchains, digital ledgers used to store information, are not climate-friendly because they guzzle computing power. The Tree says it saves energy by running on Polygon, a blockchain that uses a fraction of the power, and offsets each transaction by sending money to Greenpop, an environmental organisation that plants trees across Sub-Saharan Africa.

Andrew Hauser, executive director for markets at the UK central bank, said the digital currencies such as TerraUSD and Tether lack real-time information about their value and details about how they maintain convertibility. Stable they are not, Hauser said Wednesday in a text of remarks prepared for a panel hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Holders of such coins must accept at least the possibility of finding themselves badly out of pocket. The remarks are part of the BOEs effort to build the case for regulating digital currencies, which they see as an increasing risk to the financial system. The $1.7 trillion market is now bigger than the subprime mortgage were when they upended global markets in 2008. TerraUSD and Tether once were key to the digital currency system, offering users a predictable way of trading money. Yet the former saw its value recently fall to zero over the course of a few days, while the latter dropped below parity. Hauser said that regulators will take a greater interest in the securities as their use grows. Buyer beware warnings may be sufficient for coins that are only in niche use, but they cannot be enough for any that reach systemic scale, Hauser said. Those rules may require issuers to back such coins with deposits at the central bank, he said. His remarks also covered a number of other digital currency topics, noting that:","Reed Landberg, Bloomberg",moneyweb,Neutral,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The largest cryptocurrency was up 0.6% at $29,938 at 10:20 a.m. in London, while Ether rose 1.6%. Bitcoins advance largely tracked that of European equities. Bitcoin has only briefly deviated from the $30,000 level since the collapse of the TerraUSD stablecoin triggered a broad crypto selloff in early May. The token could form a cyclical low in the second half of this year, based on previous market cycles, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Jamie Douglas Coutts said Wednesday. The technical outlook is neutral at best and Bitcoin really needs to trade back above $40k before any kind of bullish outlook can be confirmed, Nicholas Cawley, a strategist at DailyFX, wrote in a note Wednesday. Bitcoin had staged a mini-rally to start the week, rising to a three-week high of $32,359 on Tuesday and giving some in the markets hope that it might gain upward momentum.

The company plans to lay off roughly that amount, ending the current quarter with about 5,000 employees. Until recently, the company didnt acknowledge the arrival of a crypto winter, even though its shares have been dropping since it went public more than a year ago. They are down nearly 80% year to date, according to Bloomberg data. Laid off employees will receive a minimum of 3.5 months of severance, plus two weeks for every year of employment.

Bitcoin clawed its way to positive territory after falling as much as 7.3% to $20,816, its lowest since Dec. 2020. It was last up 0.2% at $22,487. The worlds largest cryptocurrency fell 15% on Monday, its sharpest one-day drop since March 2020. It has shed about half its value this year and over 20% since Friday alone. Since its record high of $69,000 in November, it has slumped nearly 70%. Citing extreme market conditions, New Jersey-based Celsius said on Monday that it had frozen withdrawals and transfers between accounts to stabilise liquidity and operations while we take steps to preserve and protect assets. The move, combined with expectations of sharper U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate hikes after high U.S. inflation data last week, pushed the value of the crypto market under $1 trillion for the first time since January 2021. Most crypto players were pessimistic on bitcoins immediate prospects. With the broader risk sentiment firmly negative the sellers have had it all their own way for a few days, said Richard Usher at crypto firm BCB Group, adding that demand from medium term investors was returning. It will take a shift in the overall risk sentiment to turn the price around significantly. Bitcoins fall could also see wider consequences. U.S. software firm MicroStrategy Inc  a major backer of bitcoin  said last month a drop below $21,000 would trigger a demand for extra capital against a loan secured by some of its bitcoin holdings. That could see it stake more bitcoin against the loan or trigger the sale of some of its vast holdings. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside business hours. No. 2 token ether also recovered somewhat after losing as much as 10% to $1,075, a fresh 15-month low. Ether is down 75% from its record high of $4,869, hit in November.  Celsius, which has around $11.8 billion in assets, offers interest-bearing products to customers who deposit crypto at its platform. It then lends out coins to earn a return. The market is now panicking about the impact and contagion if Celsius becomes insolvent, wrote Singapore fund manager QCP Capital in a note. Crypto-linked stocks also tumbled, with MicroStrategy plummeting 25%, and crypto exchange Coinbase Global losing 11.4%. Crypto investors were already rattled by the collapse of the TerraUSD and luna tokens in May which were shortly followed by Tether, the worlds largest stablecoin, briefly breaking its 1:1 peg with the dollar. Higher U.S. inflation has not only roiled cryptocurrencies further but also other asset classes as investors dumped risky assets, with the S&P index falling for four days straight.","Tom Wilson and Elizabeth Howcroft, Reuters",moneyweb,Negative,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Barely a month after the dramatic collapse of the Terra blockchain, whose Anchor protocol enticed investors with annual yields of almost 20%, crypto lender Celsius Networks halted withdrawals and some other transactions on its platform offering similarly eye-popping returns. Those active in the space insist that these are just growing pains for a young industry rather than glaring flaws that reveal profound existential issues, yet the episodes still have the power to shake up the ever-changing world of crypto finance. For all our crypto coverage click . What is happening with Celsius will have serious repercussions for the industry, said Mahin Gupta, founder of Liminal, a digital-asset custody platform. Its a not-insignificant player, and its apparent failure will have ripple effects. Read: .@CelsiusNetwork is pausing all withdrawals, Swap, and transfers between accounts. Acting in the interest of our community is our top priority. Our operations continue and we will continue to share information with the community.  Celsius (@CelsiusNetwork) June 13, 2022 Gupta and other professionals involved in crypto draw a sharp distinction between Celsius and the world of DeFi protocols. While Celsius is one of the big participants in the DeFi space, the company itself is more like a centralised bank or other financial middleman than a collection of DeFi smart contracts and algorithms governed by the democracy of token holders spread out throughout the world. Still, the episode that followed so closely on the heels of the Terra implosion highlights the inherent risk that  like the traditional banking system during the global financial crisis  various digital assets can be so tightly linked that a problem in one area can set off a greater unraveling, putting the whole construct under distress. Both Terras failure, which was triggered when that blockchains stablecoin lost its 1-to-1 peg to the U.S. dollar, and Celsius withdrawal freeze have exacerbated losses across a wide variety of cryptocurrencies. And both episodes have coincided with turmoil in traditional markets as the U.S. Federal Reserve embarks on a campaign to tame raging inflation by aggressively raising interest rates and reversing the easy-money policies it put in place during the Covid-19 pandemic. Investors should be keenly aware of how interconnected the different DeFi products are, as well as that they are all being impacted by Federal Reserve policy, said Hilary Allen, a law professor at American University who specializes in financial-stability regulation. There is no crypto safe haven. Observers are blaming much of Celsiuss issues on a token called Staked ETH, or stETH, which is an IOU fully backed by the Ether cryptocurrency. The token is issued in return for Ether that is staked, or locked up, until Ethereum completes its merge with an updated version of the blockchain and a follow-up upgrade. Staked ETH is 100% backed by Ether and while it has been trading at a discount to that token recently, that is no big deal in normal markets, according to Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer of Arca Capital Management. But this is not a normal market anymore  collateral values are shrinking, market liquidity is drying up, and lenders are struggling and pulling back, he wrote in a recent note. Thats caused the price of Staked ETH to deviate significantly from the token its meant to track. When that happens, trouble ensues since stETH is a token that can also be used as collateral for other loans. Said another way, a non-event suddenly becomes an event if cascading liquidations occur due to the temporary de-peg.  To Cam Harvey, a Duke University finance professor and author of a book on DeFi, Celsiuss woes are indicative of a failure of risk management on the companys part, not a sign of a crisis that threatens the broader space. Celsius didnt appreciate how illiquid that Staked ETH could be, Harvey said, ultimately leaving it in a poor position to meet demands for withdrawals akin to an old-fashioned bank run. To go into something thats relatively new that hasnt been around for a while and just assume that this is super liquid? That to me is a stretch, he said. I do think it will change behavior in terms of other companies, who will say Hey, we need to take scenarios like this into account. The Celsius episode is also likely to lead to a higher emphasis on counterparty due diligence and transparency when it comes to the flow of funds and performance of loans built into DeFi lending protocols, according to Sid Powell, CEO of Maple Finance, a lending marketplace for institutions. But dont expect the innovations of DeFi to disappear anytime soon, its proponents say, regardless of how widespread the pain is during the current bear market thats referred to as a crypto winter. Crypto and DeFi are stronger than any single participant, said Henry Elder, head of DeFi at digital-asset manager Wave Financial. Or, as Arcas Dorman puts it: This too shall pass, and it will again be a case study of whether or not we want to live in a fake world like TradFi where all problems are immediately fixed with Too Big to Fail bailouts, or if we want to live in a new regime where these relationships will eventually work themselves out  but many will suffer pain as it plays out.  2022 Bloomberg","Bloomberg News",moneyweb,Positive,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The worlds largest digital token shed as much as 10% to reach $20 824, the lowest level since December 2020. It then pared some of the drop to trade at $21 899 as of 11:20 a.m. in Singapore. A range of other tokens from Ether to Avalanche were also nursing losses. Sentiment for cryptos is terrible as the global crypto market cap has fallen below $1 trillion dollars, said Edward Moya, senior market analyst for the Americas at Oanda. He added a drop below the $20 000 level could lead to even uglier price action. Cryptocurrencies have become emblematic of a flight from speculative investments as monetary policy is tightened around the world to fight price pressures, draining liquidity from global markets. Crypto lender Celsius freezing withdrawals on Monday exacerbated worries about the stress in the digital-asset sector, which was already on tenterhooks after the collapse of the Terra/Luna ecosystem.  Traders are also monitoring MicroStrategy Inc, whose big bet on Bitcoin is backfiring. The firm loaded up on the coins and chief executive officer Michael Saylor became a flag-carrier for Bitcoin bulls with his nearly relentless optimism. Among the issues weighing on the company is the threat that an even deeper drop in the tokens price will require it to post additional collateral for loans. More than $1.1 billion was liquidated in the crypto markets on Monday  about $685 million of longs and $468 million on the short side, according to Coinglass data. Thats the most for both longs and shorts in at least the past three months, the data showed. Strategists were looking for signs of a crypto bottom.

68,2022-06-14,"The world of crypto lending explained",https://www.moneyweb.co.za/moneyweb-crypto/the-world-of-crypto-lending-explained/," Major U.S. cryptocurrency lending company Celsius Network froze withdrawals and transfers on Monday, citing extreme market conditions, sparking a sell-off across crypto markets. Heres what you need to know about crypto lending  a corner of the digital asset market that has boomed over the last two years during soaring interest in cryptocurrencies.  Crypto lending is essentially banking  for the crypto world. Just as customers at traditional banks earn interest on their savings in dollars or pounds, crypto users that deposit their bitcoin or ether at crypto lenders also earn money, usually in cryptocurrency. While savings at traditional banks offer paltry returns due to historically low interest rates, crypto lenders offer much higher returns  at the very top end as much as 20%, though rates depend on the tokens being deposited. Crypto lenders make money by lending  also for a fee, typically between 5% to 10%  digital tokens to investors or crypto companies, who might use the tokens for speculation, hedging or as working capital. The lenders profit from the spread between the interest they pay on deposits and that charged on loans.  They are. Crypto lending has boomed over the past two years, along as decentralised finance, or DeFi, platforms. DeFi and crypto lending both tout a vision of financial services where lenders and borrowers bypass the traditional financial firms that act as gatekeepers for loans or other products. The sites say they are easier to access than banks, too, with prospective clients facing less paperwork when lending or borrowing crypto. The total value of crypto at DeFi sites soared to a record $110 billion in November, up fivefold from a year earlier and reflecting record highs for bitcoin, according to industry site DeFi Pulse. Traditional investors and venture capital firms, from Canadas second-biggest pension fund Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec to Bain Capital Ventures, have backed crypto lending platforms.  There are several. Unlike traditional regulated banks, crypto lenders arent overseen by financial regulators  so there are few rules on the capital they must hold, or transparency over their reserves. That means that customers who hold their crypto at the platforms could lose access to their funds  as happened with Celsius on Monday. Read: Crypto lenders also face other risks, from volatility in crypto markets than can hit the value of savings to tech failures and hacks.  New Jersey-based Celsius is among them, with over $11 billion assets in its platform. Other major lenders are also based in the United States. New York-based Genesis originated loans of $44.3 billion in the first quarter, with $14.6 billion in active loans as of March. Other big names include U.S. lender BlockFi, which has some $10 billion of assets under management, and London-based Nexo, which has $12 billion.  Crypto lenders are in the sights of U.S. securities watchdogs and state regulators, who say that interest-bearing products are unregistered securities. In February, BlockFi agreed to pay $100 million in a landmark settlement with the U.S. SEC and state authorities over its yield product. Those same state regulators issued a similar cease and desist order to Celsius in September, calling its Earn product an unregistered security. More widely, DeFi is throwing up risks for investors as it evolves to mirror traditional markets, a global body for securities regulators said in March, including a lack of disclosure of products and systems, patchy reliability and problems operating at scale.","Tom Wilson, Elizabeth Howcroft and Hannah Lang, Reuters",moneyweb,Neutral,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The cryptocurrency crashed over 17%. In fact, it was 12% at the time of writing, but the day got worse for it. I suppose that even extends the losses that were wiped out from the crypto market to beyond $200billion. But lets get the take of Sean Sanders, the CEO of Revix. Sean, we need to stop meeting like this. Every time you come on the show, its bad news for your world. Yeah. I dont know what to say. It might be just our conversations. Good evening. How are you doing? Good evening. Im great. I dont think you are though. Tell us whats behind the latest  is it a crash, or is that overstated in the crypto market right now given the fact that, yes, we are seeing big losses across stock markets, but not to the quantum that Bitcoin and other cryptos are registering. Whats going on? Well, over the weekend you had news develop about Celsius. Celsius is essentially one of the top 10 crypto platforms globally. Its probably the second-largest lending platform within the crypto space, and theyve halted all of their withdrawals. So thatll send ripples throughout the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. It has been a brutal period. Whether or not that is whats been driving the decline may have been one of the factors, but youve seen Bitcoin down 15%-odd today, Ethereum down 17%. Im looking at the seven-day price chart, and Ethereums down 33%, Bitcoin 23%. So it has been a brutal, brutal period. Youve seen the market cap  and thats the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies  fall from a high of about $2.9trillion all the way down, now below the trillion-dollar mark of R980billion. So to say that this has been a sell-off would be an understatement. This has been a brutal, brutal period to be in crypto. What do you do, during this period?Well, if youve invested, youve got to sort of take a longer-term stance. You can either choose to sell out now, which is what a lot of people are doing. We have seen within the South African space, and certainly internationally as well, a lot of investors choosing to cash out their cryptocurrency, and turning that into fiat currency and moving that out of the crypto sphere. But this is sort of the opportunity. If youre looking out way into the future and you believe that crypto actually has a place in your portfolio and a place in society, this is where bargains are made. Right? Maybe. If we circle back to your the reference to Celsius, that crypto-lending company, [which has] around 1.7million customers who perhaps cant get their money right now  you say that theyre the top 10  what about the others? What could their halting of withdrawals, citing extreme market conditions, possibly mean for other crypto lenders? Are we expecting to see them follow the same course? Well, there has always been this air around Celsius, where theres been, I guess, strange dealings that have happened with the directors and some sort of senior management within that company. Theres a lot of other crypto lenders out there. Nexo is another provider, and Blockfire. These other entities have got slightly different licensing arrangements. Theyve been quite outspoken about Celsius over the years. Its always easy to say this in hindsight. I must say as well that Celsius isnt sort of down and out. Theyve halted withdrawals. Thats literally been announced this morning. They may very well come back. But what does it mean for the rest of the market? Certainly, when looking at crypto platforms and all the rest, there are a bunch of really top-class, top-quality platforms out there. They do treat their customer funds just like a bank. They follow the right processes and all the rest. But I suppose these lenders in this space, the likes of Celsius, do essentially take more risk than your normal crypto exchange or crypto-investment platform. I think whats happened here is Celsius seems to have been caught out. So just in terms of where to from here, I read a comment that in the previous bear markets Bitcoin had dropped around 80% from its last record high, and that currently it is down around 63% from its last all-time high, which was hit in November. This particular analyst said that we therefore could see much lower Bitcoin prices over the next month or two. Id like to know your view on that  do you agree or disagree? Well, I think if you look at the fear-and-greed index, which is used in all asset classes but really used within crypto given that sentiment is such a big driver of the market, youre sitting at the lowest levels that you can possibly get. At the moment 11 out of a 100 [is] extreme fear. So could we go lower? Yeah, we definitely, definitely could. If you saw the number of liquidations that happened within the crypto space just earlier today, they hit a new record as well. So there has been a lot of blood on the street, as they would say. And yeah, the crypto market could definitely, definitely drop lower. Is that my base case? I have said this on the show before: I actually dont know and I dont pretend to be able to guess whats going to happen in the crypto market over the next few months. I think when you look out over the much longer term, thats essentially why Ive chosen to build the business in this space, because thats what excites me. But I think over the short term sentiments definitely pointing negative. I dont see there being a higher probability of upside relative to downside. Its really, really negative at this stage.Sean, well leave it there for now. Thanks for the honesty, [for] not pretending to know it all. Its refreshing.

The meltdown is the latest blow to DeFi, or decentralised finance, cryptos answer to traditional finance, with more control and less costs for users but also less oversight and more risk. Doubts about the sky-high yields backing products such as those Celsius offers haveafter the collapse of the Terra ecosystem in May, and as tighter monetary policy across the world curbs demand for riskier assets. The CEL token promises actual financial rewards, including as much as 30% extra returns weekly, according to its website. While the collapse of the TerraUSD (UST) stablecoin captured most of the markets attention, one of the projects main attractions for investors had been its promised interest rate, set as high as 20% for UST deposits in the Terra blockchain-based lending project Anchor. Celsius was an investor in the project. Both revolve around the promise of super-high yields to keep up demand, which itself depended on a steady flow of new entrants feeding the system, or borrowing to pay the high rates.

Bitcoin has tumbled 47% this year, while Ether has lost about two-thirds of its value. Theres No Hiding From the Bad News This Time: John Authers The Celsius news added fuel to the fire, adding to the uncertainty in the market, said Vijay Ayyar, vice president of corporate development and international at crypto platform Luno. There is a lot of pressure on prices as we go into the week of Fed decision coupled with concerns on the protocols offering high-yield products. Tokens linked to lending and borrowing protocols underperformed on Monday, with their overall value down 10% compared with a 6.4% drop in the broader crypto universe, according to CoinGecko. Celsius peers Aave, Maple and Compound slumped 12%, 15% and 13%, respectively. Ethereum blockchain data shows that the largest single digital wallet holding CEL tokens is a wallet that belongs to Celsius itself, with more than 184 million CEL tokens, or 26.6% of the total supply in circulation. Mashinsky clarified in a weekend tweet that Celsius hadnt been selling the token. Ran, no need for a debate Dylan just did not know we have published our wallets for the past 5 years and anyone can see we were not selling CEL. see at the bottom of this page  Alex Mashinsky (@Mashinsky)  The collapse of the TerraUSD stablecoin and its sister token Luna in early May spawned widespread skepticism of the juicy returns crypto lenders like Celsius and decentralized-finance platforms have been promising investors. Anchor, a project linked to the Terra ecosystem, had offered yields of roughly 20% before TerraUSD, or UST, crashed. The plunge of Celsiuss token $CEL seems to be a realization of the contagion risk of UST/LUNA into similar financial tools, said Burak Tamac, senior analyst for regulatory and on-chain at CryptoQuant.","Suvashree Ghosh and Sidhartha Shukla, Bloomberg",moneyweb,Neutral,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The worlds largest digital token tumbled as much as 8.9% to $24 903.49  its lowest since December 2020. Other cryptocurrencies also declined as a broader sell-off continued. The MVIS CryptoCompare Digital Assets 100 Index, which measures 100 of the top tokens, dropped as much as 9.7%. Cryptos remain at the mercy of the Fed and stuck in a merry dance with the Nasdaq and other risk assets, said Antoni Trenchev, co-founder and managing partner of crypto lender Nexo. Were hearing Bitcoin forecasts in the mid-teen and single-digit thousands which tells you the type of macro environment crypto is facing for the first time  and the levels of fear.  Traders are boosting bets for a more aggressive pace of Federal Reserve tightening after data Friday showed US inflation jumped to a fresh 40-year high in May. Cryptocurrencies, which have struggled amid the Feds policy in recent months, have been hit particularly hard. The collapse of the Terra/Luna ecosystem last month, and lender Celsius pausing withdrawals Monday morning Asia time, have further eroded confidence in the space. Typically, Id suggest being a buyer here on Bitcoin futures, said Rick Bensignor, president of Bensignor Investment Strategies and a former strategist at Morgan Stanley. But if you do get long, perhaps think about doing so with either a long call spread or short put spread to limit risk. If this dives, theres no reliable support nearby. Other coins were also having a difficult time, with Ether off as much as 12% to its lowest level since February 2021. Avalanche dropped as much as 15%, Solana up to 14% and Dogecoin as much as 11%. If Ethereum continues to bleed toward $1 200 (the 200-week moving average) the outlook for other altcoins becomes even bleaker, Trenchev said.  2022 Bloomberg","Joanna Ossinger and Suvashree Ghosh, Bloomberg",moneyweb,Neutral,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1
73,2022-06-13,"Crypto criminals walk free because of lack of resources",https://www.moneyweb.co.za/moneyweb-crypto/crypto-criminals-walk-free-because-of-lack-of-resources/," Specialist police officers in the UK have reached out to financial fraud lawyers for help in obtaining justice for victims of small-scale crypto fraud. The Criminal Prosecution Service [CPS] in the UK has limited resources and will only prosecute cases which it thinks have a very strong chance of success, says Vanessa Whitman, a finance disputes lawyer who specialises in crypto at the international law firm CMS. Police in the UK have the skills to trace down bad actors in crypto crime, she tells Moneyweb, but the problem in obtaining convictions stems from a resourcing issue.  Many complaints being fielded in the UK are similar to those voiced by members of Mirror Trading International and Africrypt, two South African crypto schemes that lost investors billions of rands after promising outlandish returns. Law enforcements focus on big-ticket crypto scams leaves victims of smaller-scale crypto thefts  such as 1 000 (about R20 000)  without justice or compensation for their stolen funds. Such amounts dont make the same headlines that the  do, but these crimes are evidently far easier to get away with.  Victims are [feeling] an increasing sense of frustration, and so are the police, says Whitman. In an effort to obtain some degree of justice, victims will often turn to civil lawyers like Whitman for assistance. But the costs of civil prosecution often make any potential victory a pyrrhic one. Instructing civil lawyers to go and get court orders to serve on exchanges is very expensive, says Whitman, and if you are a victim who has lost a couple of thousand pounds or dollars worth of crypto, thats soon going to be eclipsed by the cost of any legal action.  An entire industry of blockchain analytics has grown around tracing cryptocurrency movements. And the same technology can be used to trace dirty crypto. Every transaction on a blockchain is logged and publicly accessible. The transaction shows how much was transferred, from which wallet address, and to which address. The enforcement folks have got really good at working out who people are, says Charles Kerrigan, a crypto and digital assets lawyer at CMS. So you can trace connected addresses. And you can see clues that indicate where the person might be located, or who their affiliates might be, or other projects that theyve been involved in, both positive and negative. Criminals leave a trail of breadcrumbs that inevitably lead to an exchange that requires identification to convert that crypto to fiat currency. And then law enforcement can pounce. One of the hard problems, if youre a criminal thats using crypto to launder funds, is that you may have a paper net worth of a vast amount, but its just inaccessible, Kerrigan tells Moneyweb. There was a very large hack a few years ago and those funds had sat there for four or five years. And it was just publicised that the hackers in New York have been found and arrested. Some of those coins had gone through mixers, and privacy coins, and been through 50 000 transactions. But not even 50 000 transactions put them beyond the reach of the software and surveillance that applies to it. Mixers are decentralised crypto services that mix multiple sources of crypto to obscure their source. And privacy coins are cryptocurrencies that attempt to obscure blockchain transactions so that privacy can be maintained.  The other factor thats needed to help victims of small-scale crypto crime is buy-in from exchanges, Whitman says. In one case she worked on, she attempted to obtain cooperation from the 20 largest exchanges to block a particular wallet address that she and her team had unequivocally linked to stolen crypto. The range of responses she received was an eye-opener. Whereas some exchanges were highly cooperative in the interests of preventing fraud within the industry, others ignored the request altogether or simply refused to cooperate in the absence of a court order. A few exchanges completely misunderstood the meaning of the message. The broad range of responses tells us that something must be done to standardise the approach of the exchanges, she says. Whitman adds that there is also a lot of goodwill in the crypto industry that comes from players really interested in wanting to see the crypto ecosystem succeed. This helps offset the Wild West reputation that crypto has acquired.  Retail investors sometimes dont have all the information, says Kerrigan. Many are relatively inexperienced investors, and that inexperience can end up costing them five or 10 grand. These smaller losses, when aggregated, add up to a tidy sum, but its because theyre made up of small amounts that they do not get the attention they deserve. Losing a few thousand rand is not like losing R5 million or R5 billion, but it does have an impact on crypto adoption. So you just cant have things like that happening, says Kerrigan. We need to have tools that are available at a large scale and a small scale. Theres every incentive to chase down the big ones. We also need to ensure that weve got the incentives and the tools to chase down the small ones. The other problem is that even if law enforcement suddenly had more resources to tackle every case, criminal law is more about punishing the criminal rather than compensating the victim. This can leave the victim short of their stolen funds, even if justice has been obtained for the crime itself. Whitman and Kerrigan are working with others in the crypto sector on a proposal that could revolutionise the way crypto crime is prosecuted in the UK and, if accepted, could be exported elsewhere in the world to countries like SA. The proposal seeks to implement quick access to justice for victims of crypto crime on a self-management basis, without the need for costly lawyers. The proposal is still at an early stage, and details are still a little sketchy, but Whitman is hopeful it will offer a much-needed solution for victims of crypto crime.","R Paulo Delgado",moneyweb,Positive,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
74,2022-06-16,"Serum Review: Solanas One-Stop DeFi Toolbelt",https://www.coinbureau.com/review/serum-solana/," DeFi saw tremendous growth in 2021, with the total value locked (TVL) in DeFi products and protocols peaking at $250 billion in December 2021. While most of this TVL was concentrated in the Ethereum ecosystem, we have now begun to seeas projects and TVL are migrating to other chains such as BNB,,, etc. Among these chains, Solana is leading the charge in DeFi due to its low transaction costs and incredible speed. In particular, the Serum protocol has been a significant player in simplifying the process for DeFi projects to onboard and share liquidity in Solana. Serum has helped a number of projects such as,,, Jupiter, etc., build amazing DeFi products while leveraging Serums central limit order book and matching engine to enable frictionless trading. In this article, we take a closer look at the Serum protocol to find out who is behind it, what makes it promising and whether it will survive in the long run. Page Contents  []  is a permissionless base protocol layer for decentralized exchanges built on the Solana blockchain that allows developers to create their own DEX user interface on top of it. On the protocol level, Serum features a fully on-chain, non-custodial order book mechanism that allows users of DeFi projects leveraging Serum to place on-chain bid or ask orders with specific prices.  The central order book of Serum also allows DeFi projects using it to benefit from true composability and access to ecosystem-wide liquidity. Being built on Solana, Serum enables users to execute trades with low latency and incredible speed at affordable and cheap network fees. Serum also has its own tokens called SRM and MSRM that unlock trading fee discounts for holders based on the number of tokens held. According to, Serum currently occupies 3rd place in overall TVL within the Solana ecosystem, with over $222 million in assets locked on its platform. The Serum Project was built by the Serum Foundation, which is backed by several heavy-weights in the industry, such asand the teams at FTX, Alameda Research, and the Solana Foundation. Serum officially launched on 31st August 2020 and was one of the first major open-source projects to build on Solana.  Serum was built as a solution to the problems faced by DeFi users on Ethereum in the summer of 2020. Defi platforms were extremely limited in functionality at the time, and users had to pay high gas costs to transact on them. To solve this and provide a better experience for DeFi users, the Serum Foundation decided to build Serum on the Solana blockchain, which processes transactions at 65,000 transactions per second. The team also decided to provide users with an on-chain order book, unlike other DEXs that typically use a liquidity pool, to give them an experience similar to centralized exchanges. The Serum DEX took about three months to develop, with the whitepaper being released in July of 2020.  When it first launched, Serum featured its own basic trading interface that developers could fork and build upon to integrate with the Serum protocol. However, once enough projects had started to develop their Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) on Serum, the protocol removed the trading interface so that all trading activity comes via several GUIs built on top of it. While Serum does not host its own trading user interface anymore, its current model allows it to host one of the most vibrant and liquid Defi ecosystems. Developers and projects are incentivized to build on top of Serum to gain access to its massive liquidity via the central limit order book system. A few exchanges built on Serum The liquidity and ease of creation allow developers to focus more on creating an efficient suite of Defi products hosted on an attractive and easy-to-use GUI. This has led to Serum becoming one of the most popular protocols on Solana for Defi projects to build on. To put it simply, its success is due to four key features: Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like ,  and  employ an automated market maker (AMM) that utilizes a liquidity pool to swap assets instantly and determine a price based on the ratio of assets present in it. In contrast, centralized exchanges like , , or  use an order book mechanism to facilitate the trade of assets. AMM vs Order Books Order books allow users to set limit orders and stop-loss orders. These orders enable the user to specify the price at which the order must be executed. AMMs, on the other hand, do not allow the user to specify the price at which they want to buy/sell the asset. Instead, the user is shown a live price based on the ratio of assets in the pool, at which they can buy/sell the asset. If youre thinking, Order books sound pretty convenient. Why dont DEXs offer them? Heres why. Most DEXs are built on Ethereum, a network whose relatively long latency makes an on-chain matching engine inefficient. This means that on-chain order books are not practically possible. However, Serum can use an on-chain central limit order book mechanism because it is built on Solana. The Solana network produces blocks every 400600ms, thats more than 10x faster than Ethereums 14-second block time (on average). This makes Serums on-chain central order book and matching engine quite efficient. Serum allows developers and projects to build more efficient DEXs by allowing them to access a central limit order book and matching engine that shares liquidity with other projects and DEXs building on top of it. In addition, the Serum protocol works in the back-end allowing developers to focus on creating efficient and attractive GUIs and financial products. Thus far, 30 GUIs have been listed on the official. Each of these GUIs offers various decentralized finance products. For example,offers margin trading and perpetual futures,offers spot and limit order trading, andoffers swap price aggregation services. DeFi in the Ethereum ecosystem is fragmented, with liquidity in one protocol unable to be accessed by another. Serum solves this by allowing a diverse range of applications and participants to share middleware in one place. This makes Serums architecture more suited to modularity. As a result, serum-based programs will offer more flexibility while adhering to some basic design principles and composability. The Serum DAO handles the governance of the protocol. Serums SRM token acts as the governance token used to vote for or against proposals. The Serum DAO has awhere community members can discuss various issues and eventually create a governance proposal for key issues on the official. Serum DAO Users must hold a minimum ofto create a governance proposal. To vote on a governance proposal, users must connect their wallet to the official governance page and deposit all their tokens. Then, they can choose to vote in favour of or against a particular proposal. While the vote is in effect and the voting period is ongoing, the tokens will be temporarily locked up. After the proposal is closed, the tokens are returned and can be withdrawn from the governance page. Serum Core is an asset agnostic order book system built bythat is yet to be released. If youre wondering what an asset agnostic order book is, heres the ELI5 version. Basically, the Serum protocol, afully on-chainorder book protocol, executes trade on-chain by calling a smart contract and transferring the SLP tokens after the matching engine matches two orders together. This means that the matching engine requires the transfer of SLP tokens under the basic Serum protocol. This becomes a problem for projects that want to introduce products such as perpetual futures trading under Serum, as they would have to tokenize users positions to do so. However, tokenizing positions becomes tricky because it requires encoding information such as collateral, position size, entry price etc. To solve this, Serum Core was built. Serum Core allows the on-chain order book to store state information and match positions without tokenizing them. Under Serum Core, the order book itself is a matching engine. When a match occurs on Serum Core, the matching engine triggers the creation of a position owned by the taker and held with the maker. Serum Core also allows projects to create their own order book or work with other existing order books. Order book exchanges generally have two fees: a maker fee and a taker fee. A maker fee is charged to a user who makes an order or supplies liquidity to an order book. A taker fee is charged to a user who accepts an order or removes liquidity from an order book. The Serum protocol only charges users a fee for taker orders. This means that maker orders are not subject to a fee as they provide liquidity. Since Serums matching engine fulfils these orders, it charges taker orders a fee ranging between 3 basis points (bps) to 4 basis points (bps). The fee levied depends on the amount of SRM tokens you hold. The collected protocol fees are split into two- 80% of the fee goes towards the buyback and burn of SRM, and 20% of the fee goes towards the project or GUI hosting the activity. Serum Fees Discounts You can find the different fee discounts and the corresponding SRM holding in the picture above. Apart from these fees, the different GUIs building on top of Serum might also charge their own fee. The Solana network will also charge a minimal transaction fee, and in certain situations, it might also charge something known as an open order account rent fee. The open order account rent fee is 0.02 SOL per market pair. It is charged when trading a market pair for the first time and is used to create the intermediary open order account that interacts with the DEX. This fee can later be recovered if youre not planning to use that pair again. Serum is a decentralized protocol and does not follow any KYC or account verification process. Moreover, the different GUIs built on top of Serum might have their own KYC or AML process. But generally, most GUIs do not have any KYC or AML due to their decentralized nature. All you need to use the platform is aand some SOL tokens to pay for network fees. Serum has been privately audited. A public audit for the next version of Serum, called Serum V4 or Serum Core, is currently underway. Serum supports trading any SPL token as long as there is a market and liquidity for it. Moreover, the anticipated release of Serum Core will enable the trading of defi products such as Perpetual Futures without needing to tokenize them on the network. Serum does not host its own trading interface. Instead, it relies on the different DeFi projects building on top of it to do so. Many of these GUIs on top of Serum are very user-friendly and efficient. These GUIs provide users with a customized and unique trading experience, making Serums ecosystem quite diverse. You can find all sorts of defi products, such as a derivatives exchange, swap aggregator, crypto index, lending platform, etc., built on top of Serum. Primarily, Serum was designed to be a base protocol for the different Defi projects in the Solana ecosystem. It seems to have been able to stay true to this vision so far. Serum is a non-custodial protocol. It enables peer-to-peer trading between the different wallets in the Solana blockchain. As such, there are no deposit or withdrawal charges on Serum directly. However, remember that the different GUIs on top of Serum might have their own custodial features, such as collateralization account for derivatives or margin trading.  The Serum Project has two tokens in its ecosystem- SRM and MSRM. Both tokens exist as SPL tokens on the Solana blockchain. The SRM token is Serums utility and governance token. SRM token holders can vote on governance proposals in the Serum DAO and also avail of trading fee discounts based on the number of tokens they hold. MSRM token is a special token with a limited supply of 1000 MSRM. MSRM tokens are created by locking up 1,000,000 SRM tokens in a contract. They offer holders additional benefits and rights such as increased discounts and the ability to run a node. SRM has a maximum supply of 10,161,000,000 SRM tokens, and MSRM has a maximum supply of 1000 MSRM or 10% of SRM supply. Serum began with 10% of its token supply unlocked, with the other 90% slowly trickling into circulation in the form of validator and staking rewards over the next 6 years, beginning on the 11th of August 2021, at approximately 1/2190 per day. SRM Price History via The SRM token first began trading in August 2020. The token reached an all-time high of $13.72 in September of 2021 and an all-time low of $0.11 during its IEO in 2020. According to, the token is currently trading at $0.90 with a market cap of $236 million. The current price is due to a declining interest in Defi amid the current bear market conditions. SRM can currently be bought on both centralized and decentralized exchanges. The available markets are listed below Centralized Exchanges-,, Gate.io Decentralized Exchanges-and Serum DEX Yes, SRM can be staked to earn rewards and participate in governance. SRM can also be staked to run a validator node, earning you additional rewards. To run a validator node, you will need 10 million SRM tokens, with 1 million of them in the form of 1 MSRM token. Validators in the Serum project have two primary duties: to support cross-chain cryptocurrency swaps and . The second function refers to the fact that orders on the Serum DEX are not fulfilled automatically due to the nature of the Solana blockchain  they must be manually activated by a third party, in this case, a validator node. Serum is a decentralized project run by the Serum DAO. It has an active developer base with the Serum DAO granting funds to projects developing on Serum. While there may not be any customer support in the traditional sense, users can get their doubts or queries addressed in the projects Discord or Telegram channels. However, in my experience, the projects Discord channel is not as active or responsive as most other crypto discord servers. So you might have to wait a while or ask a question repeatedly before being able to secure an answer. Serum is an excellent protocol for DeFi projects and developers on the Solana ecosystem to build on due to the following reasons- Shared Liquidity All projects building on top of Serum share the liquidity and central order book. This makes the trading experience through consistent price feeds and larger trading volumes. Ecosystem The more projects built on top of Serum, the bigger its network and role in the Solana ecosystem. Permissionless Users of Serum can create market pairs on Serum without permission or authorization. It is a permissionless decentralized protocol that allows users and projects to leverage Serum in any way possible. Composability Projects built on Serum are truly composable with each other. With the upcoming release of Serum Core, the composability of projects on Serum will only get better. Serum is a great protocol with incredible promise for the Solana ecosystem. However, it can be challenging for beginners to learn or understand the project due to its not-so-optimized documentation practices. This is one area that Serum must definitely work on. While researching for this article, I found that the protocol has gone through many changes in the past two years, but the documentation of these changes was not so easy to find. Their official documentation can also do with more details on their security audit status or how the DAO governance works in better detail. Apart from the problems with documentation, Serum also seems to be suffering from a lack of support for newcomers in their official Discord channels. I noticed that researchers and beginners have left many questions unanswered by the moderators or team. This does not bode well when building a strong, engaging community. Serum is a truly promising project that has achieved many of its goals since its launch. It also has backing from some of the best minds and teams in crypto, such as Sam Bankman-Fried, FTX and Solana. The Serum Core is an anticipated upgrade to the current order book of Serum that will help bring to life many more projects on the Serum DEX.  The Serum Project was built by the Serum Foundation, which is backed by several heavy-weights in the industry, such asand the teams at FTX, Alameda Research, and the Solana Foundation. Serum officially launched on 31st August 2020 and was one of the first major open-source projects to build on Solana. The SRM and MSRM tokens are used to unlock discounts in trading fees, run a node and participate in governance proposals. The Serum Project is built by a solid team with backing from Solana, FTX and Alameda Research. The Serum protocol is open source and is awaiting the release of its public security audit report. SRM is the native token of the Serum Protocol, which ranks 3rd in TVL held across Solana. Currently, DeFi and its overall TVL are dwindling due to the bear market caused by macroeconomic factors. However, DeFi could see a significant uptick in user activity and interest by the time the next bull run rolls around, leading to a price increase for tokens whose protocols have survived during the bear market. Moreover, the Serum protocol powers a number of DeFi products on the Solana blockchain, leading to a wider use case than most other Defi tokens.

75,2022-06-11,"Raydium Review: Solanas DeFi Liquidity Mammoth",https://www.coinbureau.com/review/raydium-solana/," Thehas been notorious forover the past three months. This has caused recent sentiment around Solana to turn sour, but there is no denying that it has one of the best teams backing and building on it. This is why I thinkmight still be around in the top 10 during the next bull run. One of the reasons Solana still deserves credit despite its outages is its incredible transaction throughput and what it can do for DeFi. Solanas DeFi ecosystem, in my blasphemous opinion, is in some ways superior to whatcurrently provides. And no, Im not talking about the low gas costs. Im referring to Solanas incredibleand its network of decentralised exchanges building on top of it. Serum allows DEXs built on top of it to leverage its central on-chain order book, leading to cross-exchange liquidity, which benefits users! But thats not all. There are a ton of applications building on top of Solana that deserve individual attention due to their innovative models. For example, last month, we took a look atand what it has done for on-chain derivatives trading. This time, were exploring another diamond from the Solana ecosystem that provides the best liquidity and spot trading features for the ecosystem- Raydium. Raydium utilises Serums on-chain central order book for trading, allowing users to access trading features similar to those found at centralised exchanges. At the same time, Raydium can access and supply liquidity from its pools to other DeFi protocols within the ecosystem. In this article, we take deep-dive into what Raydium is, who is behind it, and whether its the right exchange for you. If you have a question, weve probably answered it here. Read on! Page Contents  [] is an automated market-maker built on the Solana blockchain that allows its users to trade, swap and earn a yield on digital assets. Being built on Solana, Raydium enables users to execute trades at instant speed and near-zero network costs.  Like most decentralized exchanges, Raydium employs a liquidity pool system for users to swap assets. However, Raydium does this by leveraging thebuilt on Solana. The Serum DEX integration allows users to gain access to an ecosystem-wide central limit-order book system that provides unparalleled liquidity compared to other platforms. Raydium also has its own token, RAY, which provides holders various benefits such as a share in protocol earnings, and access to the platforms native launch pad AcceleRaytor. In the future, RAY is expected to also act as a governance token granting holders potential governance rights. According to, Raydium currently occupies 4th place in overall TVL within the Solana ecosystem, with over $317 million in assets locked on its platform. Raydiums development began in the summer of 2020 and was founded by pseudonymous developerand their team. At the time, DeFi was just starting to pick wind and AlphaRay, a seasoned trader tired of Ethereums high gas costs, was looking for a solution to fix this. So he reached out to the FTX team and told them about his vision. In turn, FTX introduced AlphaRay to two projects they had been closely involved with and worked on- the Solana blockchain and the Serum protocol. Image via AlphaRay, along with other team members, saw the potential of Serum DEX and began building Raydium, which launched in Feb 2021. Raydiums team has over two decades of experience in market making, arbitrage, and high-frequency trading in cryptocurrency and traditional markets. AlphaRay is in charge of Raydiums overall strategy, operations, product direction, and business development. He has a background in commodity algorithmic trading, but in 2017 he shifted to cryptocurrency market making and liquidity provision. Other notable team members include GammaRay and XRay. GammaRay is the marketing and communications director. He is in charge of product development and strategy. His crypto speciality before joining Raydium was discretionary marketing and technical analysis. XRay is the Chief of Technology and the leader of the Development team. He has around eight years of experience in crypto and regular markets trading and systems architecture. X is also the architect of Raydiums infrastructure and systems. Raydium primarily offers four key features to its users: Raydium Features via The trading experience on Raydium is similar to DEXs on Ethereum, but with two key differences- unparalleled liquidity and the ability to place limit orders on select tokens. Both these features are possible due to Raydiums integration with Serum DEX. If youve never heard ofbefore, Serum is a base protocol layer for decentralised exchanges that allows developers to build their own DEXs on top of it. This allows exchanges leveraging Serum to access and share liquidity through its on-chain central limit order book system. Raydium also offers users a choice between two different trading experiences within its platform- Limit-Order Book and Swaps via liquidity pools. Raydiums Limit Order Book interface provides users with an experience similar to centralised exchanges, where the user can watch the price chart of the desired token pair and the top buy or sell bids placed by users of the exchange. Raydium Limit Order via As the name suggests, it allows users to place limit orders on selected tokens featured on its trading interface. Limit orders allow users to specify the price at which they would like their trade to execute. This allows users to experience a relatively stress-free trading experience compared to most other DeFi exchanges. Currently, Raydium actively supports around 260+ market pairs on its user interface. However, users can access and add any new market pair not listed on the interface as long as it has an existing market on Serum.  To add an existing market pair on Serum to Raydium, users need to create a custom market on the interface by clicking the + symbol above the trading chart on the interface and adding the market id of the desired pair. Be careful, though; certain custom market pairs might be deprecated, do not trade on them. Raydium also has a swap interface that enables the swapping of assets in a liquidity pool by using a constant function market-maker to determine prices. This interface might be familiar to those using decentralized exchanges on the Ethereum ecosystem for a while. Raydium Swap Interface via However, unlike its Ethereum counterparts, Raydiums AMM interacts with Serums central limit order book, which means that pools have access to all order flow and liquidity on Serum, and vice versa. This allows Raydium to offer users the best price possible for their swaps. Raydium does this by analyzing and determining whether swapping within a liquidity pool or through the Serum order book will provide the best price for the user and executes accordingly. Users can execute trades for any SPL token (SPL or Solana Program Library is Solanas Token Standard) as long as it has an existing liquidity provider or. Users can farm rewards in the form of RAY tokens by providing liquidity to the Liquidity Pools on Raydium. In addition, the exchanges permissionless pool system allows anyone to create a liquidity pool for any SPL token pair on the platform. This eliminates any whitelisting process for liquidity pools on the platform. Raydium Farms via Liquidity providers on Raydium earn a share in the total transaction fees earned by the platform by staking their LP tokens in farms. Around 88% of the fees collected are re-routed to the liquidity pool and earmarked as rewards for liquidity providers. The remaining 12% rewards RAY tokens for the staking pool. Raydium allows holders of its native token RAY to earn additional RAY tokens by staking on the platform and earning interest. Currently, the RAY staking pool offers a 10.29% interest rate on staked RAY. AcceleRaytor is Raydiums native launchpad that helps projects raise capital and drive initial liquidity in a decentralized manner. It is a part of Raydiums efforts to spearhead and promote development in the Solana ecosystem. This is generally achieved through launching an initial token offering on the Raydium platform. The Raydium team curates and vets projects to determine if they are a good fit for the platforms vision before listing their tokens on the launchpad. Raydium Launchpad via Participation in token offerings on AcceleRaytor is decided by a lottery system. Eligible users must enter tickets into the lottery and win a chance to invest. The more tickets you have, the higher your chance of winning an allotment in the IDO. To gain access to tickets, users must generally stake at least 100 RAY tokens for a minimum period of 7 days before the snapshot date. The longer you stake, the more tickets you win. Raydium charges a 0.25% fee for both maker and taker orders when executing a swap in its liquidity pools. This 0.25% fee is split and distributed as follows- For orders fulfilled via the Serum DEX, the transaction fee is paid to Serum and is determined by the number of SRM tokens staked. Generally, Serum charges an average of 0.22%, which decreases based on the amount of SRM held. Apart from the fees charged by Raydium for the use of its platform, users must also be mindful of network fees. Solana transactions typically cost between 0.0001  0.001 SOL. Raydium is a decentralized exchange and does not follow any KYC or account verification process. All you need to use the platform is access to aand some SOL tokens to pay for network fees. Moreover, unlike most IDO Launchpads, Raydiums AcceleRaytor does not require any KYC to participate in its IDO launches. With regulation around the world increasing, it is unclear how much longer this would be possible. Though, enforcement of regulation on decentralized applications remains nearly impossible. Raydium received anin 2021 by Kudelski Security and has since undergone numerous changes. Therefore, while a full re-audit is currently underway, the team has received extensive reviews from members of theteam via a bug bounty agreement. Raydium Initial Audit via AcceleRaytor, DropZone and stable-curve AMM programs have not yet been audited. However, an additional full audit that will review all upgrades and more recent programs is planned for Q2 of 2022. Moreover, Raydiums AMM uses the constant function pricing curve k=x*y to determine price according to the ratio of tokens in a liquidity pool. This means that Raydium does not rely on an outside oracle at this time for pricing feeds, eliminating the risk of Oracle manipulation in flash-loan attacks. Similarly, Solanas low latency and high throughput reduce the risk of front-running transactions. Currently, Raydium supports over 20, including Solflare, Sollet, TokenPocket,,, and Bitkeep, to name a few. Raydium Supported Wallets On the matter of supported cryptocurrencies, there is no bottom in sight as Raydium supports the trade of all SPL tokens on its exchange, as long as a liquidity pool or Serum market exists for the desired token pair. Furthermore, Raydium also supports wrapped versions of other tokens from different blockchains, such as wrapped BTC or wrapped ETH. The Raydium Platform is easy to use and navigate from a design perspective due to its simple layout and clean UI. All the website features are functional, and the text is easy to read. The darker colour scheme is easier on the eyes in low-light surroundings. The platform is also compatible with mobile devices and can be accessed via the mobile browser. The team is currently working on a cleaner, more optimized version of the platform for mobile devices. My only gripe with the platform is its limit order book interface. Some text seems to be squished together in certain areas of the site. However, this does not seem to affect its functionality. Just a visual eyesore. Moreover, the team seems to be actively addressing and resolving issues with the platform at the earliest opportunity. Raydium is a non-custodial exchange. This means that users do not deposit assets onto the platform to execute trades; rather, the platform facilitates seamless peer-to-peer trading via smart contracts in on-chain order books or swapping of assets in liquidity pools.  The Raydium token (RAY) is an SPL token that runs on the Solana blockchain. The RAY token is intended to be a governance token for the protocol in the long run. Currently, it grants holders a claim on a portion of trading fees collected by the exchange. Each trade or swap on Raydium incurs a 0.25% fee, where 0.22% goes to LPs (liquidity providers), and 0.03% goes to a staking pool that rewards users staking their RAY tokens on the protocol. Also, users wishing to gain access to the AcceleRaytor launchpad must stake RAY for a certain duration. RAY has a max supply of 555 million tokens minted at launch. More than 60% of the token supply is split between Mining Reserve (34%) and the Ecosystem and Partnership fund (30%). These tokens will be used to develop the ecosystem and reward early community members who have staked RAY. The team has a 20% allotment of the token supply with a three-year vesting period. The remaining tokens are split between the liquidity for AMM at Launch (8%), the community pool (6%) and advisors (2%). The community pool and advisor tokens are subject to a vesting period of 1 and 3 years, respectively. Raydium Price History via According to, RAY seems to be currently trading at $0.80, its all-time-low, with a market cap of $91 million. The token reached an all-time high of $16.93 during the peak of Solanas rally from $30 to $200 in September 2021. The current price of RAY is likely a result of Solanas dwindling DeFi TVL caused by its recent serial outages and, of course, the current bear market. RAY can currently be bought on both centralized and decentralized exchanges. The available markets are listed below Centralized Exchanges-,, Gate.io Decentralized Exchanges- Raydium and Serum DEX Yes, RAY can be staked atto earn staking rewards. The current rate of interest is 10.29% APR.  Raydium has responsive customer support with multiple channels for customers to get their issues addressed. Users can contact the Raydium team and raise support tickets via , or Telegram. I personally found the discord channel to be more responsive with at least one moderator present in the group at all times. Raydium is an excellent platform for trading tokens on the Solana ecosystem due to the following reasons- In terms of improvement, the first thing to address would be an expansion of the current range of products. While liquidity might be shared due to being integrated with Serum, Solanas DeFi ecosystem is fragmented, with users hopping between different decentralized exchanges to gain access to different products, i.e. margin trading, derivatives trading, etc. Id like to see an exchange that offers many products similar to centralized exchanges. Of course, I understand the difference in the size of operational teams between the two might make this wishful thinking. But a man can hope. Trading Charts on As for more realistic areas of improvement, Raydiums trading chart feature on its limit order book interface is something that most traders appreciate. It allows users to mark and draw trading patterns. However, it remains limited to the trading pairs whitelisted by Raydium unless youre willing to manually add a custom market and spend some SOL on network fees in the process. In my opinion, Raydium could improve on this by increasing the number of trading pairs on the limit order interface or by launching a dedicated trading chart interface for all assets on Solana. Raydium is undoubtedly one of the top DeFi projects to launch on Solana providing incredible liquidity for users. Their launchpad is also a force to reckon with, having launched many quality products in the Solana ecosystem, such as,, etc. Raydium is an excellent choice if youre thinking about exploring DeFi on Solana for the first time. Its user interface resembles most DEXs on Ethereum while also showing users Solanas promise of low latency trading and on-chain order books. So far, Raydium has been transparent with its documentation and audits. Raydium is also currently in the process of a security audit with. While its development team remains anonymous, they have worked closely with Solana and FTX teams while developing Raydium. Raydium charges a 0.25% fee for both maker and taker orders when executing a swap in its own liquidity pools. For orders fulfilled via the Serum DEX, the transaction fee is paid to Serum and is determined by the number of SRM tokens staked. Generally, Serum charges an average of 0.22% which decreases based on the amount of SRM held. RAY is the native token of the Raydium exchange which ranks 4th in TVL held across Solana. Currently, DeFi and its overall TVL are dwindling due to the bear market caused by macroeconomic factors. DeFi could see a significant uptick in user activity and interest by the time the next bull run rolls around, leading to a price increase of tokens whose protocols have survived during the bear market. Raydium and FTX or Binance fill two separate needs of crypto investors. While FTX/Binance are centralized and regulated exchanges, Raydium is a decentralised protocol that is unregulated. FTX/Binance might be more suitable for relatively risk-averse investors who dont mind leaving their crypto on regulated exchanges. Raydium on the other hand might be more suitable for a more experienced and risk-hungry investor who cares about maintaining privacy.

76,2022-06-10,"Crypto.com Exchange Review 2022: A World-Class Crypto Exchange",https://www.coinbureau.com/review/crypto-com-exchange/," Here at the Coin Bureau, we find ourselves writing and filming quite a bit of content about Crypto.com. After all, they are one of the largest crypto companies in the world, boasting a massively successful platform with over 50 million users, launched one of the most popular crypto debit cards, have a multitude of products, and developed its own blockchain network ecosystem that is growing at an insane pace. Because of that, there are always a lot of things changing and new products to be covered, which leads us to this Crypto.com Exchange review that brings you here today. With all that being said, a company spinning so many plates have understandably caused a bit of confusion with their multitude of different products, apps, and features, so out of respect for your time and to make sure you didnt stumble across the wrong article, this review is strictly for the Crytpo.com Exchange, not the Crypto.com platform app.is an exchange for crypto trading. The Crypto.com platform features the Crypto.com debit card, Crypto.com Earn, Supercharger, NFT marketplace, and Crypto.com Pay. If you are looking for information about the Crypto.com platform or the Crypto.com DeFi Wallet, that info can be found in our. Now, with that out of the way, lets get down to the nuts and bolts of what the world-class Crypto.com Exchange offers.

Crypto.com Platform: 7 fiat currency support Crypto.com started as a company called Monaco in 2016 before undergoing the brilliant rebrand to Crypto.com in 2018, a smart marketing move on their part after acquiring the domain name for $12 million. The Crypto.com platform became massively popular, exploding in user adoption thanks to the Crypto.com platform and the Crypto.com debit card, which helped fund the decision to expand even further and launch the Crypto.com exchange in 2019. If you are interested in the companys history, we go into more detail in the Crypto.com Platform Review linked above. In the interest of brevity, well skip all that here and stick with the exchange. Image via Crypto.com The Crypto.com Exchange is a popular crypto trading platform where customers can trade over 200 spot crypto pairs, over 100 pairs using 10x leverage, over 100 perpetual markets and 7 futures markets. It is a highly secure, regulated, and reputable crypto trading platform that is available via web browser and mobile application, open to users worldwide and US-friendly. Note that Crypto.com has two apps, one for the platform and one for the exchange. Downloads for both can be found on the. **Important** For any app associated with finance or crypto, always use the app download or redirect link directly from the company website and avoid searching in app stores. Scammers can put up false apps that are nearly indistinguishable from the originals, complete with fake reviews and download numbers which have caused millions in stolen customer funds. In addition to the exchange itself, which supports API integration for things like EAs/bots/algorithms, the platform also offers a way for customers to purchase tokens at a discount in something called The Syndicate. There is a Trading Arena, a VIP programme and something called Supercharger, which is like anlottery which we will cover in this review. If you are looking for Guys take on the Crypto.com Exchange, he happens to have a review of the exchange as well:  Great, now that we covered some of the background, lets get into the exchange features.  The Trading Arena is where traders can compete and win exclusive prizes. Trading competitions and a gamified style of Vegas-type trading competitions have become very popular and are common among exchanges like the Crypto.com Exchange,, and. Image via Crypto.com Looking at some of the past events, traders could put their skills to the test and win prizes like $65,000, $100,000 worth of SPS from theTrading Battle, win tickets to Bitcoin Miami, and more. There are also lucky draws and trading races to keep trading exciting and provide skilled traders with more value than simply winning trades. A Look at the Past Splinterlands Trading Battle. Image via Crypto.com For those traders with deep pockets, members of the VIP programme may be eligible to enjoy special perks and higher rewards. The VIP Programme will be covered in detail further on. Once traders have registered for a trading competition, they will want to keep an eye on the leaderboard to see how they are stacking up against the competition. Trading Competition Leaderboard. Image via Crypto.com These trading competitions are a great way to attract traders to the platform. They are generally popular among traders who enjoy a bit of competition and fun. This feature is fairly new for Crypto.com and will likely get better; they will have some catching up to do if they want to compete with KuCoin, who, in my opinion, has the best games, perks, and prizes for active day traders. Supercharger is a feature available in both the Crypto.com App and Exchange, and it is something quite unique that I really like. It is a simple, flexible, and secure rewards platform that allows users to stake tokens that can be withdrawn at any time. In return, they earn popular crypto tokens daily that get deposited directly into their account. A Look at Supercharger. Image via Crypto.com It sort of feels like playing an airdrop lottery that always wins. You simply stake some CRO, and you get drip-fed daily rewards during the rewards period for whatever the reward token is, which can range fromandto smaller cap coins and newer projects that you may not have even heard of before. Crypto.com will announce the event, letting you know what the reward token is. If the reward is a token a user wants, they can stake some CRO during the charging period, which can be withdrawn at any time. The reward amount is based on the amount of CRO staked by the user, then paid out daily over the reward period, which can be 10, 30, or 45 days. Here is a simple two-step infographic on how to participate; it couldnt be easier: Image via Crypto.com I also like that this can be done passively. Once you participate in one event, you can select your CRO stake to automatically roll over to the next event. One of the reasons I found this feature great is that it can help diversify your portfolio, and often the reward token is for something I either want to HODL anyway, like BTC or ETH (nothing like free tokens!), or you can get rewarded with small-cap projects before they really take off and enjoy some nice capital appreciation. If you want to get into the nitty-gritty on how rewards are calculated and all the details on Supercharger, check out Crypto.coms. The Syndicate is another unique feature on the Crypto.com Exchange. Users can purchase new coins and tokens listed on the exchange at a deep discount. No need to tell you how rewarding this could be. Imagine if Binance had offered something like this when a token like(CAKE) launched. I wouldnt have said no to a piece of that sweet cake goodness at half price as the token saw near-vertical price action. Normally, the way The Syndicate works is that Crypto.com offers half a million dollars worth of the token to users who can pick up the token for a 50% discount, basically giving average traders VC-style access to discounted tokens. Here is a look at some of the previous Syndicate events: Image via Crypto.com The Syndicate is a fundraising platform for some of the most promising crypto projects, which list their tokens on the Crypto.com Exchange. CRO holders who stake CRO in the exchange receive priority token allocations and get first dibs at picking up these tokens at a discount. Here is a look at the CRO staking allocation and trading volume requirements that were needed to participate in theevent: Image via Crypto.com In order to participate in The Syndicate listing events, users need to: Here is a look at a previous Syndicate event for Filecoin to give you an idea of how it looks: Image via Crypto.com Be sure to keep an eye on the listing event timeline to know when the staking period runs and so you know when you will receive your allocation at the designated distribution time. I dont know of any other exchanges that offer a feature similar to Crypto.coms Syndicate. It is a significant attractor to the Crypto.com Exchange for those who want to take advantage of buying crypto at discounted prices. For the caviar eating, red carpet walking crypto guys and gals, the Crypto.com Exchange has a VIP Programme for you! Image via Crypto.com There are 3 VIP tiers that traders can fall under depending on their 30-day trading volume. Each tier allows them to enjoy some exclusive trading incentives and perks: A Look at the VIP Tiers. Image via Crypto.com This VIP program is in place to entice large volume traders and whales to the platform. Interestingly, the VIP program is only available to retail clients; no institutions are allowed. VIP 3 provides the lowest fees Ive seen offered by most crypto exchanges. As if those rock-bottom Crypto.com Exchange fees arent enough to entice traders, the VIP programme also provides the following benefits: It must be nice to sit at the cool kids table with swollen crypto bags and receive all those additional perks. As for me, my version of ballin out during a bear market is when I get to buy fancy aged cheese instead of the stuff that comes in single plastic wrappersYou know, the ones that arent legally allowed to even be called cheese? Yeah, you know what Im talking about. Cheese? No Thanks, Give Me Some of Them Merica Slices. Image via Yeah, those ones. Not great for impressing the in-laws when you show up with a pack of these instead of the salad they asked you to bring. This is a great additional feature to the platform that I quite like as it makes using dollar-cost averaging strategies automated and effortless. In addition, the Crypto.com Exchange has a DCA Trading bot accessible directly from within the platform; no complicated APIs, coding experience, or shady bot download websites are needed. Image via Crypto.com The bot allows platform users to sell or build their positions by placing orders automatically based on pre-set parameters. This means that you dont need to constantly watch the charts to jump in at the right time, leaving more time to hang out at the local milkshake establishment, enjoying some cold ones with your friends. The DCA bot allows users to automatically buy and/or sell crypto regularly over a pre-set time frame. It is useful for investors or traders who want to reduce the influence of volatility and average their way into or out of positions. DCA Bot Settings. Image via Crypto.com Once users set up the bot, they can name it and save the template to deploy the bot with the desired settings at the click of a button at a later date. Of course, the bot can be paused, ended, and its settings edited. The best part is this bot works for free. There are no additional fees to use it. If you are interested in automated trading and trading bots, check out our article where we dive into, and see if they are right for you. Customers can perform two staking functions on the exchange: CRO staking to unlock certain benefits or Soft Staking. Crypto.com Soft Staking offers users a new way to earn rewards up to 4% in interest annually on crypto held on the exchange, such as BTC, LTC, ETH and more. Rewards are offered on a flexible term with no lock-up period required. The max limit is dependent on how many CRO users have staked. Not bad, earning 4% on crypto just sitting there. Staking CRO on the Crypto.com Exchange provides users with a multitude of benefits such as: Here are the CRO staking benefit levels: Image via Crypto.com There is an impressive list of Crypto.com exchange-supported currencies and markets for traders to choose from. Regarding rankings, the top exchanges, Binance, KuCoin and FTX, offer more trading pairs and markets, with Crypto.com being in the middle as they offer more thanor. Crypto.com Exchange has come a long way over the past year and is only getting better all the time, now supporting: With these numbers, most traders will likely find something they fancy trading. The Crypto.com Exchange supports the following order types: As Crypto.com is one of the most heavily licensed and regulated crypto platforms around, I could not find a designated list of countries that are not supported. Reading the T&Cs, it looks like it is basically supported pretty much everywhere. Image via Crypto.com Aside from sanctioned countries, what I can make of this is that Crypto.com is available to be used in any country that doesnt outlaw crypto trading, which is pretty good. Ah, fees are always a fun topic. Crypto.com Exchange fees come in at a standard 0.4% Maker fee and 0.4% Taker fee for Tier level 1 without the CRO stake discount, placing the Crypto.com Exchange cheaper than Coinbase but slightly higher than FTX, Kraken, and Binance. Here is the fee table for Spot and Margin trading: Image via Crypto.com Here is the fee table for Derivatives trading: Image via Crypto.com There are two ways that users can lower these fees. The first is by doing A LOT of trading. Naturally, the Crypto.com exchange wants to entice whales and those who intend to trade high volume, so the more you trade, the cheaper the fees. If you trade over two hundred million dollars worth in a 30-day period, you can cut those fees down to 0.04% for Makers and 0.1% for Takers. The other way to save on fees is to stake CRO. CRO staking provides the following discounts: Fiat, other than USD, is not yet supported on the Crypto.com Exchange, and theyjustannounced USD support through bank transfer via SWIFT, with more fiat support likely coming soon. Image via Crypto.com Users who are not able to transfer USD via SWIFT have two options for funding their exchange accounts: Note that withdrawals from the Crypto.com exchange to your Crypto.com wallet addresswillincur a fee unless you use the Withdraw to App Function, which segues us into this pro tip to save you money: Pro Tip: Use thefunction to avoid crypto network fees when moving money between the Crypto.com exchange and Crypto.com platform. Withdrawing crypto from the exchange to external addresses will incur network fees which are highly variable and dependent on the network and token. Refer to thefor information about crypto withdrawal fees. After experiencing a pretty nastyin early 2022, Crypto.com has upped its security and now boasts some of the industrys highest security standards and accolades. It is good to see that all users who lost funds were fully reimbursed by the Crypto.com team. They have since significantly boosted their security measures and standards. Image via Crypto.com The platform drives a Zero Trust and Defence in Depth security strategy across all its systems and platforms. Data privacy assessments are built into the processes that protect and encrypt user information. Here is a look at some of the security features deployed by the Crypto.com team: Image via Crypto.com I like that 100% of customer funds are held offline in cold storage, meaning that corporate funds are used for daily customer transactions and exposed to risk. For USA-based users, fiat deposits are held in regulated bank accounts insured for up to $250,000. Crypto.com was the first crypto company in the world to achieve all of the following security milestones, certificates and compliances: From a customer perspective, the following security features can be utilized: The unfortunate hack aside, Crypto.com is one of the most heavily secured platforms, meaning that users should be able to sleep sound at night knowing their funds are as safe as they can be on a centralized platform. One thing I like to see is that the original founders of Crypto.com are still on the executive team, meaning they are dedicated to the company, the platform, and the vision. I often feel that too much shuffling of upper management is often a sign of troubles brewing. After all, if things are going well, why hire and fire? To me, a change of upper management can be akin to a losing sports team firing the coach. Crypto.com was founded by the following members: The team is made up of industry professionals with proven track records of success, and all executive and senior management have enjoyed successful previous ventures and high-ranking positions before founding and working for Crypto.com. Here is a bit about the executive team taken from the: Image via Crypto.com Whitepaper As the company expanded and is now a global enterprise, adding new team members was necessary. The Whitepaper highlights the other members of the senior management team, and I must say there is quite an impressive roster of heavy hitters. There is a lot of information about the specific team members that you can check out if you like; I will list the highlights that stood out to me: The list seriously goes on for ages. There are 10 pages in the Whitepaper highlighting the teams experience and accolades; they have some awe-inspiring talent on the team. The thing that stands out to me is how many higher management members they sniped from Google, Binance, Coinbase, PayPal and Visa, must be a heck of a place to work, and with an all-star roster like that, watch out! The early days of support werent great, to be honest, but after the profitable 2021 bull run that allowed Crypto.com to expand and market like crazy, it is good to see they also invested in scaling and training their support team as it is now fantastic and I cant find fault with it at all. I have personally reached out to the Crypto.com team for my account dozens of times, and I have always received a response typically between 10 minutes to 3 hours. I recently had a bit of a complex and unique case that required the collaboration of multiple different support members that lasted over 4 or 5 days. A team member stayed on the chat with me the entire time, providing progress updates, and they had to be flexible to accommodate the request and worked hard to resolve the issue before a looming deadline, providing me with absolutely stellar support and resolution, so a big kudos to them. A Look at the in-app Chat Support The team can be reached via live chat from within the app or online platform, as well as the email. The team is also very active and responsive on, and they have a well-built-outthat should be able to help resolve most questions and queries. Opening an account on Crypto.com Exchange is pretty straightforward; nothing too crazy here. An account can be opened in about ten minutes should everything go okay with ID verification. You can sign up to the account without submitting any KYC documentation if you just want to poke around and have a look at the platform, but if you want to deposit, trade, or withdraw, you will need to provide the following information: This will get you to the starter level tier, which will most likely be enough for the average trader as it allows for a $5,000 withdrawal per day. If you need to withdraw more than 5k in each 24-hour period, you will need to pass further account verification. Users who need to withdraw more than 5k, up to the equivalent to 100 BTC per day, will also need to provide: Note that for standard use of the Crypto.com Platform, the ID submission and selfie are a standard requirement, so if you use the Crypto.com app, then open up an exchange account, you will already have the higher level of KYC requirements needed. The trading interface on the Crypto.com Exchange is clean, intuitive, and easy to use, as you would expect from a world-leading crypto exchange. I might even take it a step further and say the effort they put into the UX/UI of the exchange makes them one of the more pleasant exchanges to use. Image via Crypto.com I took a look at some of the reviews online and could not find much in the way of negative criticisms against the exchange when it comes to issues like slippage, orders not being fulfilled, or dirty deeds like Crypto.com being suspected of wash trading, front running traders, or restricting withdrawals, it seems most traders have a pretty positive experience which is a plus. It really is a professional-grade, reputable world-class exchange and the order fulfilment is rated very highly thanks to the full revamped upgrades to the matching engine and order management systems undertaken in 2020, which led to a 10x increase in platform performance. Here is a look at the additional improvements implemented during that time: Image via Crypto.com When looking at the interface, plenty of technical analysis tools are available as the charting space is powered by TradingView. In addition, I like that the open orders, order history, tools, and the order book are all on the same screen, preventing the need to swap between different screens for different purposes.  I also like that you can swap between spot, margin, and derivatives trading without changing screens or platforms. It is quite a simple and functional platform for trading. I would rate it among the top trading platform interfaces alongside FTX and Binance. While the preferred trading method is using the Crypto.com exchange via web browser for the bigger screen and additional functionality, the Crypto.com exchange also has a mobile app for trading on the go. Remember that Crypto.com has two different apps, one for the Crypto.com platform and one for the exchange. Image via Crypto.com As far as trading apps go, the Crypto.com Exchange is well designed, functional, and very well laid out, making it easy to use and navigate. Though it is important to note that the app has limited functionality vs the web platform. These are the functions that can be performed on the app: I have used quite a few trading platforms and mobile trading apps in my day. I dont generally recommend them as a primary trading tool. Any professional trader will likely tell you that trading is not a joke. It is a serious job that isnt to be done from a mobile phone while standing in line at a Starbucks or stopped at a red light. Most serious traders have multiple screens and tabs open for multiple data sources. Their TA set-up is marked out well beforehand, and much of their time is spent switching between different tabs on different screens, something not easy to do on a mobile device. Most Professional Trading Setups Look Something Like This. Image via Shutterstock The only time I would personally use mobile trading apps is to monitor open positions while out and place or close the odd trade, but never as a primary trading tool. Though as far as trading apps go, the Crypto.com exchange app is very good, the team designed it to make it as functional as any trading app Ive used and better than many out there. If you would like to learn more about technical analysis, we have an article about, and if you prefer video format, Guy also has a great 3 part series on performing TA:  Yes, Crypto.com follows industry best practices when it comes to security and regulation. They are highly respected in the industry, used and trusted by millions of users worldwide. They hold some of the highest licenses available in the crypto industry and exceed many industry standards. In my opinion, yes. This is simply due to the fact that the Crypto.com Exchange has more trading option and lower fees, but both are great platforms. I would say Coinbase is better for beginners. No. FTX has seen the fastest growth and adoption of any crypto trading exchange, taking the number two spot in trading volume. They achieved this by being an incredible, top rated exchange that is functional and filled with features. Check out our  to learn more. Though for features not trading related to trading like earn, crypto cards, NFT marketplaces, etc. the Crypto.com platform outshines what is offered by FTX in my humble opinion. As Crypto.com is committed to the future of blockchain, they have taken ambitious steps in creating an entire crypto framework and are contributing massively to the entire industry, leaving many investors bullish on the project. Crypto.com is aiming to create a more efficient crypto ecosystem to rival the likes of Binance and Ethereum. Users who feel that advancing the crypto industry in this way are bullish on projects that undertake this feat, and many investors feel that Crypto.com is standing on a strong foundation and likely to see continued growth. Yes, Crypto.com is dedicated to bringing the next billion people into crypto and understands that user-friendliness is paramount. Ease of use is built into everything they launch. One of the issues that institutions and traders with large accounts may have with the Crypto.com Exchange is that trading liquidity and volume is pretty low compared to the top exchanges. This could negatively impact traders who place large orders, resulting in order filling being slow, or experiencing slippage. Image via Coin Market Cap To be honest, I havent actually heard of this being an issue at Crypto.com, I just know that these are issues that can be caused by low volume and have seen that this is a concern that has prevented some firms from opening up institutional accounts at Crypto.com. The good news is that volume is increasing as more users start using the exchange, and since the platform launched its Market Maker Programme attracting liquidity providers, this is becoming less of a concern. Crypto.com Exchange Market Maker Program Attracts Liquidity Providers. Image via Crypto.com This shouldnt deter the average retail trader though, as there is still plenty of volume for the likes of us. There are quite a few negative criticisms online about the exchanges lack of trading pairs and features, allow me to address those. When the Exchange was first launched, it was pretty bare-bones, with few pairs and few features available. It almost seemed like they released an unfinished product. Most of the negative reviews are from last year, and I must tip my hat to the Crypto.com team as this platform has advanced tenfold in just one short year, so many of the year-old criticisms are no longer relevant.  For me, in full transparency, the Crypto.com Exchange is not my favourite place to trade. Though they are adding more functionality and features all the time, so in time it could be amazing, and I will be keeping an eye on it. Binance and FTX offer a more robust platform for serious traders, with more tradable markets, more features, and lower fees, making those the more popular exchanges for serious traders. I would not be surprised to see the Crypto.com Exchange see high rates of adoption and an explosion in popularity similar to what FTX has experienced in the past year in the upcoming bull run though, so definitely worth keeping an eye on it. For now, I keep an account at the Crypto.com Exchange to take advantage of The Syndicate and Supercharger, and I use the Crypto.com Platform almost daily for the reasons outlined in the , but as far as trading goes, Ill be sticking to Binance and FTX for now.

81,2022-06-01,"Digital Land: Investing in The Metaverse",https://www.coinbureau.com/education/digital-land-investing-metaverse/," As crypto investors, we are often seen as being a few fries short of a Happy Meal from traditional investors and no coiners. We do sit at the brunt of a lot of criticism and scepticism in the investment space, didnt you hear the news? Warren Buffett not only thinks Bitcoin is rat poison, but Remember that Mr. Buffett also passed on Amazon and Microsoft stocks in the early days. The Oracle from Omaha has been wrong about a few things, so I dont let that bother me. Mr. Buffett talks about Bitcoin the way a heartbroken high school kid slanders their ex on social media after a bad breakup. Warren, what did that mean old Bitcoin do to you? Maybe they are right, maybe our elevator doesnt go to the top floor, and perhaps we are the investor equivalent of that guy who tries to eat soup with a fork. Just when they thought we couldnt go any madder as we buy magic rainbow internet money that has no purpose or value, weve raised the crazy bar and are now buying magic imaginary real estate in virtual fairy tale lands. Gif via Tenor If we are crazy, talk about doubling down on our commitment and confidence in digital property. What we are going to explore in this article is digital land and metaverse investing and go over why this concept may not be as crazy as it sounds. Disclaimer: I invest in many of the projects mentioned in this article as part of my personal investment strategy. Nothing in this article is investment advice, metaverse investing is incredibly speculative and high risk. This article is for educational purposes only, do not make investment decisions based on the information presented here.  Page Contents  [] This is a doozy of a question; with no one size fits all answer. Asking what the metaverse is, is akin to asking someone what the internet is. You could ask 100 different people and receive 100 different answers. The one important thing to note is that the metaverse is not just one place, it is a global collaboration, just as the very internet is. If you think about what the internet is, it isnt Google, Facebook, or Amazon, it isnt any single entity like that, it is a global space of information accessible to anyone and contributed to by everyone. The metaverse is evolving to essentially work in a similar fashion and there are already multiple metaverses being built out. Facebook (yeah yeah, now Meta, I know) is building their own metaverse, Sony, Microsoft and Disney are building their own metaverses, and metaverses such as  and  already exist and have a user base. There are literally dozens of metaverses already underway, so it isnt going to be just one place. Image via My personal feeling is that the metaverse is going to be the next evolution or iteration of the internet we already use, a web 3.0 version of the current web 2.0 that the internet is today. The metaverse will work hand in hand, symbiotically alongside web 2. Eventually, the terms metaverse and internet may even be used interchangeably and used synonymously. Much like today, we simply use the term website, a term that hasnt changed for decades even though the underlying technology migrated from pre-HTML, through to HTML 1, HTML 2 all the way to HTML 5, users seldom care as we still just refer to them as websites. The key difference is that instead of accessing the internet with computers and smartphones, we will be fully immersed in these virtual worlds through virtual reality technology. A very simple dumbed down explanation by  sums it up beautifully, stating: I believe that just as you navigate to websites today for different companies and purposes, eventually, we will be navigating to different metaverses instead of websites. Some metaverses will be owned by companies while others will be community-owned and decentralized. These decentralized, community-owned metaverses will be places where companies and users can exist and set up shop as equals, as we have already seen with the likes of  who built the first digital bank in the Decentraland metaverse, and accounting giant Pricewaterhouse Cooper purchased land in the Sandbox metaverse. The Metaverse Will Likely be a Fully Immersive Way to Interact with the Internet. Image via Shutterstock This movement has just started and we are already seeing insurance companies, banks, video game companies, news agencies, advertisement companies and more who are all building within these virtual worlds. To get a firm grasp on what the metaverse and web 3.0 are, as these are massive topics to be explored on their own, we happen to have detailed articles that you should definitely check out. We have a deep dive explaining  and an article on If you are interested in going further down the metaverse rabbit hole, Guy also has a dedicated video on the top virtual land NFT projects: If you believe that the metaverse is the next evolution of the internet, as many do, then it is clear why there is limitless potential. If you asked someone in the early 90s how the internet may impact and shape the future, I doubt anyone would have been able to predict or fathom just how revolutionary the internet would become. The metaverse is likely to eventually encapsulate every company website, and everything we use the internet for today will take place in the metaverse. Gaming, shopping, working, tv and film watching, banking, and countless other things will likely become primarily conducted virtually. If you recall from my article on , an estimated 1/3 of the planets population are considered gamers, a figure that is growing and attracting more people to gaming metaverses. Just as most of us were not aware of our website browsing making the switch from HTML 4 to HTML 5, the 4.95 billion people on the planet who use the internet today, whether they know it or not, will be riding the internet train right into web 3, and potentially, the metaverse. Remember that internet adoption did not happen all at once, it was a trickle of users, that turned into a stream, that turned into a tidal wave, it is probable that metaverse adoption will follow a similar trajectory. Image via If you could go back and own a piece of the internet in the 90s, wouldnt you want to? Many see metaverse investing as a way to actually own a piece of the future infrastructure that will make up a huge part of our daily lives. The opinion that we will be spending the majority of our time in a metaverse is echoed by many such as Microsoft and Facebooks Meta. Metas View of the Metaverse. Image via While a totalitarian metaverse run by Zuckerberg as judge, jury, and executioner, scares the bejesus out of many of us, their  that shows all of us just chilling out and socializing in the metaverse, chatting, playing games, working, and more, I feel is a pretty good portrayal of a metaverse, but how about we use one not controlled by data-hungry, fear-mongering tech giants. Heck, even Mcdonalds, Chipotle and Wendys have launched virtual restaurants in the metaverse, so yeah, its a thing. Gonna Need a Virtual Diet Plan to Work Off These Virtual Calories Image via The metaverse will be accessible by anyone with a simple internet connection. This opens up companies to a potential global customer and client base without the logistical headaches and overhead costs of needing to physically expand your business into other countries. Collaboration will be able to thrive and exist at levels never before possible, creating limitless innovation, the likes of which we cannot even imagine today. Imagine the things that will be possible in a virtual world not restricted by the physical limitations imposed on us in real life. Lets take a look at some fast facts: It is pretty clear as to why there has been billions of dollars flowing into metaverse investment and development as this is likely going to be the place we all hang out in the near future. Think every hour we spend staring at screens now will likely translate directly to time spent in the metaverse. But what is digital real estate specifically, and what makes it so attractive? Metaverse real estate is parcels of land or property that exist in virtual worlds. In their most simple sense, they are pixels of land that make up a broader landscape that can be purchased and owned by connecting a cryptocurrency wallet, and accessed through a device with internet connection. Digital land is more than just digital images as they are programmable. Users can design them how they want and spend time there. Think of it like Minecraft but the key difference being that you actually own your items, can transfer them out of the world, and sell them for real-world monetary value. A Look at the Land Parcels Owned by Users in the Sandbox Metaverse. Image via Sandbox A common misconception about virtual real estate is that you need technical skills to participate which isnt the case for most metaverses. Popular metaverses like Decentraland have an intuitive drag and drop interface where users can create whatever they like with no coding skills required. With the rise of the metaverse, which attracts investor, company, and retail interest, the digital real estate industry is expected to grow. The virtual real estate market experienced a boom in 2021 after Facebook changed its name to Meta and announced its focus on creating a metaverse. As popularity in metaverses grows, virtual real estate is forecasted to have a . You might be asking yourself why anyone would want to invest in digital land, as it does seem a strange concept. After all, you cant build physical property on it, you cant physically live on it, and you might even be thinking it isnt even scarce. The planet earth only has a finite amount of land, which is what makes land valuable in attractive areas. A common criticism against virtual land is that we can create endless virtual worlds with limitless virtual land. We could create so much virtual land that everyone on the planet could have free access to as much land as they want, reducing any value in digital real estate at all. Anyone with any basic economic understanding realizes right away why investing in something with a limitless supply isnt always the best idea. This is one of Bitcoins strongest narratives over fiat currency as there is nothing stopping the Fed from creating new money out of thin air as we have seen in record numbers since the pandemic. Bitcoins finite supply is one of the reasons many people believe that there should be a Bitcoin standard and why Image via The ability to create an endless supply of digital land is a very valid concern, and one of the things that make metaverse investing so risky. A good metaverse investment comes down to the popularity/adoption of a metaverse and something known as network effect. We see how impactful and important network effect is on social media sites with Facebook being a great example. Everyone you talk to seems to hate Facebook and emperor Zuckerberg, yet everyone still uses it. Why? Simple, because everyone else is already there. If all your friends, family and favourite brands are on Facebook, as much as you may hate it, what is the alternative choice? You could go and start up your own, or find an alternative social media site, but if nobody else follows you, its no fun and pretty lonely being the only person using a different social media site. When None of your Friends use MySpace Anymore. Gif via VSGIF.com Metaverse dominance will have the same network effect principles in play. The two largest metaverses in terms of active users today are the Sandbox and Decentraland. Both of these metaverses have a finite supply of land, giving it value. In fact, plots of land in Decentraland have been selling for millions of dollars which is astonishing! Who would have thought that digital land would be selling for more than physical land? Once you dive into it as we will in the next sections, you will see why this isnt as crazy as you initially think. Fashion Street Estate in Decentraland sold for $3.5 Million (618,000 MANA) Image via decentraland.org As mentioned, there is finite land available in metaverses like Decentraland and the Sandbox, and similar to how a plot of land in a place like New York is going to cost considerably more than some backwoods land in the middle of nowhere that nobody wants to visit, these metaverses also have plots of land that cost more as they are in more desirable locations than others. Here is a heatmap showing cost of land in the Sandbox, highlighting that more centrally located plots are more desirable, and therefore, worth more. Image via Snoop Dogg is one of the biggest celebrities who firmly planted a flag in the metaverse. The plot of land beside his mansion in the Sandbox sold for $500k, not because there was anything particularly special about it, other than you get to be neighbours with Snoop Dogg. So, going back to the concern that we can just create another Decentraland or Sandbox, and create more virtual worlds, the network effect is powerful as there is only one Snoop Dogg, and only one tv series: The Walking Dead, and they chose to hang out in the Sandbox. There are already thousands of users in Decentraland, along with Samsung, JP Morgan, Vegas City, and gaming giant  to name a few. So yeah, we can create another world, but I want to hang out in Decentraland, playing Atari. Atari in Decentraland Image via If all your friends are in one metaverse, and gaming giant brands and entertainment companies, along with sporting events and fashion companies that are important to you are in the same metaverse, that network effect reduces the likelihood of newly created metaverses that have none of that devaluing the land owned in an already well-established blue-chip metaverse project. Supply and demand are factors that also play a role in land value within a metaverse ecosystem, but it is ultimately adoption, popularity and network effects (along with useability, of course,) that will give one metaverse value and demand over competing metaverses. These are the main factors that need to be considered when deciding whether or not digital land is a viable investment. Trying to understand why anyone would opt for digital real estate over physical real estate is a hard point to pass across the table to someone who is big on physical assets and traditional investing, and I get it. I am going to take from my own experience here and make a comparison for anyone who is interested in Bitcoin but has not made the leap to understanding the value of digital land yet, as similarities can be drawn by comparing digital land to physical land, as we can compare Bitcoin to physical cash or gold. There are a lot of people in the world whose main financial goal is to own a house with a paid-off mortgage, a sentiment that I agree with, as it is likely the best scenario for most people. Imagine all the extra disposable income you would have if you didnt need to pay rent or a mortgage. Buying a house vs renting is a topic that I have researched at length in the past and is not as black and white for everyone. For example, did you know that in Germany and Switzerland it is more favourable to rent than it is to own? Renting is Preferable to Buying in Germany and Switzerland. Image via Arguments can be made that real estate is a money pit and not always a good investment. In many countries, real estate does not appreciate as well as other assets, and since the 2008 financial crash, real estate has been steadily depreciating in some countries. In many parts of the world, investors would be better off throwing money into an index fund than purchasing a home, but these are topics for another time. Real Estate Investment Profitability is Highly Dependent on Location. Image via For me, I love the idea of having physical real estate, a tangible asset that I can live in and build on, and to know that I always have a roof over my head in case the world goes to hell in a handbasket. I would like to have one physical home for security, not necessarily as an investment, before investing in speculative digital property. Though with that being said, in full transparency for you guys as I dont want to be hypocritical, I actually own digital land and property, but no physical property, which is something I am looking to change. This wasnt entirely my choice, in my article about , I told the story about how I used to earn a salary in Bitcoin, and damn near got laughed out of the bank when I tried to apply for a mortgage. So, I thought screw it, if I cant buy a real home, Im going to buy virtual land and aped into Bloktopia and other projects where I am earning some sweet passive monthly income (more on that later). Image via Availability is a great distinction that separates physical and virtual property. For many of us, getting a mortgage or buying property can be unattainable for multiple reasons. There are far fewer barriers to entry when opting for virtual land, essentially anyone with the internet and the capital can do it. If you can spot good opportunities early, you can get in for a fraction of the cost of physical real estate and the ROI on digital land sales has smashed the physical real estate market out of the park. Some of these plots of land were purchased for mere dollars and later sold for millions, something not seen in the physical realm. If you are on board with Bitcoin, then you likely understand why it is superior to fiat money and gold due to the following principles: You can apply these same principles to digital land vs physical land. Digital land is more durable than physical land Digital land and real estate are not subject to the same hazards as physical property. No need to worry about floods, earthquakes or natural wear and tear, nor do you need to worry about upkeep and maintenance costs. Digital land is more portable than physical land Your virtual real estate can be accessed and utilized from anywhere in the world so long as you have an internet connection. Also, with cross-compatibility with NFTs, if you dont like where your digital house is built, you can pick it up and transplant it somewhere else, even between metaverses someday. Imagine saying you are tired of your apartment in New York, or your neighbourhood has become a rough area, good luck picking up your home with all its furnishings and transplanting it to another country or city. That will be theoretically possible with digital land. You can also sell or transfer your digital real estate nearly instantaneously to anyone located anywhere in the world; borders are a restriction that virtual property does not need to abide by. Digital land is more divisible With , groups of investors can share the cost and get involved with joint ownership of land and real estate far more efficiently and to a greater scalable degree than the traditional real estate industry, without pesky banks and property rights/title deed regulations getting in the way. There is nothing stopping you from drawing a contract up with a group of friends or family and entering a joint venture into digital real estate investing. Plus, with smart contracts, this can all be done in a trustless and permissionless way so you dont need to worry about people backing out of the deal or being shady. Back to the real world, there are rules and regulations in place that stipulate how many names can be on a mortgage, or how many names can be on a property title which can be a burden and a barrier. Blockchain often removes these intermediaries who enforce arbitrary rules, creating a more free and equal system. Digital real estate can have the same principles of scarcity as physical real estate As mentioned, there is a finite supply of land available in some of these metaverses, just as is the case with the real world. While a valid argument is that we can just continually create more virtual worlds, there will still be scarcity driving value if you want prime real estate in prime metaverse locations. Just for fun, here is a chart that shows what factors drive property value from a traditional perspective that we can compare to digital property:    One of the most revolutionary features of the metaverse and digital land is that virtual worlds can be created without the restrictions or restraints that are present in the physical world. Things like gravity, thermodynamics, and physics do not need to be adhered to, meaning that the only limitation is human imagination. Now, admittedly, I am not the most imaginative person on the planet, and I am sure you can come up with more creative and innovative ideas than I can, but what started opening my eyes to the possibilities of the ridiculous beauty that can exist in the metaverse was during the Cardano 2021 virtual summit. The event took place on the back of a giant turtle, surrounded by floating islands which is pretty cool imo. 2021 Cardano Summit. Image via Physical land acquisition has the burdens and hurdles of intermediaries, deeds and titles that need to be transferred, financial party interest, and endless red tape dictating what you can and cannot do with your property. We cant even begin to imagine what the full form of the metaverse will look like with the randomness of a global collaboration of the imaginations without limitations from a global population. Some metaverses will be like something out of a Dr. Seuss picture book times a million. That same imagination can be utilized to figure out the endless ways you can monetize your virtual real estate. You want an underwater M.C. Esher style home complete with friendly dolphins? You can do it, maybe charge a cheeky little entrance fee for visitors. We have already seen virtual concerts from the likes of Post Malone, who rocked out on stage with Pikachu. Ariana Grande, The Weekend, Justin Bieber and Snoop Dogg have also performed in virtual reality venues. Post Malone Performed in a Virtual Concert to Celebrate Pokmons 25th Birthday. Image via If you own a large enough parcel of land, you could be the one to rent it out for these virtual concerts, sports matches, conferences, build virtual movie theatres, arcades, bowling alleys, casinos, you name it! Advertising is also going to be paramount in the metaverse, think about all the advertising that exists on the internet today, that will all need to find a home in the metaverse. If you own land that is likely to see a lot of traffic, advertising and marketing agencies are likely to pay a fortune for the chance to put their brand up at your place. One of the common methods that I have used to earn monthly income from the metaverse is to rent out real estate to companies who want their brand seen in the metaverse. For me, this happens in Bloktopia. This works the same way as renting out office space to tenants in a physical building. My other metaverse income comes from staking and renting out  NFTs to players around the world, so there are a few different ways to capitalize here. As long as you have a piece of land in a metaverse/area that people will want to visit, the sky really is the limit for all the different ways you can monetize it. Or, for a passive approach, many investors are simply flipping digital land as it can often be purchased and then sold later for a profit. This is the million-dollar question that everybody wants to know, isnt it? The truth is, nobody has a crystal ball, and nobody knows which metaverses will succeed and which ones will fail, nor do we even know if virtual real estate is a good investment at all, which is why it is classified as high risk and highly speculative. We could all look back in ten years and go hey, remember when we were all dumb enough to buy virtual land? Then cry into our pile of Beanie Babies and Pogs that we also thought would be worth something someday. How Many People Spent Fortunes on These Thinking They Would Sell for Millions Someday? I Wouldnt Trade a Can of Beans for one Nowadays. Image via Shutterstock When weighing up metaverse investment potential, as with any risky investment, the first thing you should ask yourself is if you have enough disposable money to throw into a metaverse investment. Any money that goes into highly speculative assets like cryptocurrency should be money that you can afford to lose, which is why nearly every financial advisor and honourable crypto personality will tell you that same thing. If I had people in my life who were dependent on my income and I did not own my own home and struggled financially each month, the last thing I would be investing in is metaverse projects. If you do decide to take a crack at metaverse investing, then the traditional methods of valuing real estate should apply to your investment decision. These are things like: Location- Who are the owners of the land in your neighbourhood? Landowners in the Sandbox have raked in masses of income when big brands like Atari, Samsung, and Adidas set up shop next door. Is the location in a desirable area that you will likely be able to sell for a profit later on? Network Effects- Are there enough attractions, brands, and big names in your metaverse to continuously fuel engagement and attract users? Cost Like any investment, there are good times to buy and bad times. Many virtual real estate investors bought in at the peak of the 2021 metaverse mania only to watch the value of their properties drop significantly in value, some as much as 70% or more. Ability to Monetize- The more factors driving traffic to your area will increase your ability to monetize the property and set up additional income streams, or simply increase the value of your investment. How Long You Are Willing to Hold- Many consider metaverse investment as long term with a 5-10+ year outlook. The majority of metaverse real estate sale activity happens in the top two names in the space, Decentraland and Sandbox. These are considered the safest, blue chip metaverse investment plays. Other mentions that are gaining in popularity and growing are the likes of the Solana powered Somnium Space, , Cryptovoxels, , Bloktopia, and the Cardano powered  metaverse, along with many other fantastic looking ones in the pipeline. Image via Sandbox is the leader, dominating approximately 62% of the entire metaverse real estate market. During the 2021 virtual land boom, LAND in the Sandbox was going for an average of $11,000 for a tiny parcel, with higher-end lots going for six figures. Since the hype has died down, Sandbox LAND is now selling for an average price of $3,100. Image via The figures look similar for Decentraland with the average price for a small land plot going for just over $3,000, with some big-ticket estates recently going for $182,000. Not bad considering the initial land offering price was around $20. Being able to turn twenty bucks into six figures is one of the drivers behind metaverse land investing hype for those who are lucky enough to get in early and pick the winners. Image via While the investment may be worth the risk for many, I do think the excitement and hype about the metaverse tends to cloud the logical judgement of many in the space as so many people fomod in. There is also the question of whether or not metaverse interest will ever again reach the euphoria stage seen in 2021, as interest in the entire NFT, crypto and metaverse space has waned in 2022. Search Trends for NFTs and Metaverse are on the Decline. Image via Investing in virtual real estate is much easier than physical real estate and can be done within minutes. All you need to do is: Then of course, once you have your plot of land you can sit and hodl it or build on it until your hearts content.  The metaverse is a very exciting concept as it is something new that we cannot quite grasp the full potential or limitless nature of. But like every new technological revolution and evolution, this type of investment carries high risk. With so much development and building happening in the space as everyone rushes to become part of what could be a multi-trillion-dollar industry, it is almost guaranteed that many projects will not make it, adding another layer of risk to investors. Much like how over 90% of early internet companies have failed, many metaverse and cryptocurrency companies are likely to follow the same fate. For investors able to stomach the risk and volatility, metaverse and digital land investing offers more opportunities for revenue streams, monetization, and higher ROI potential than what is available with physical real estate. It can also be done significantly more efficiently than physical real estate investing, with clicks of a button done in minutes, instead of mountains of paperwork, red tape, and intermediates overcomplicating a process that can take weeks or months. If you are someone whose whole life is spent online, then increasing your virtual presence and investing in metaverse land could be a logical next step. But for many who still want to participate in real life, and do things like raise a family, have friends over for Sunday BBQs, and things like that, spending thousands on virtual property, and needing to spend hours online to manage your digital investments may not be the best call, especially if you do not have a physical and stable property secured for your real-life adventure game. I am a big fan of those post-apocalyptic and zombie-themed TV shows and books, and I do often find myself questioning my asset acquisition in life. As I mentioned earlier, there is something to be said for the security and safety of your physical self. If all hell breaks loose tomorrow and zombies, invading armies, pirates, bandits, or zombie pirate bandits come strolling into town, I am pretty sure that my Bitcoin and NFTs likely arent going to get me very far, and one cannot seek refuge in a virtual home, so I often feel that it is a good idea to get your physical life sorted and secure before going all-in on speculative fairy tale lands that exist in cyberspaceAlways good to have a fallback plan.

As crypto exchanges , , and  expand operations, and VC firms a16z, Babel Finance, and Huobi Ventures pour billions of dollars into funds that , Tron is the only major network that is showing bullish price behaviour that reflects the behind-the-scenes bullish confidence in the space.

Even the benchmark Bitcoin fell 4.6% while Tron jumped over 11% in a seemingly impossible task. Much of this attention is caused by Trons Terra-style algorithmic stablecoin, USDD, that Tron founder Justin Sun  would be launching at the beginning of May. It would appear that  was not enough to dispel crypto enthusiasts desire for an algorithmic stablecoin, as crypto users flood into Tron to utilize another stablecoin that many feel is nothing but a ticking time bomb waiting to follow Terras fate. It looks as if many investors may have written Tron off too quickly in the previous bull run as TRX has highlighted itself as the clear winner in recent months.

86,2022-05-30,"The 8 Best Desktop Wallets in 2022",https://www.coinbureau.com/review/best-crypto-desktop-wallets/," Believe it or not, there are still many out there not spooked by recent market conditions and are doubling down on their efforts, including me. I look at these prices and think: yay, Black Friday sale! After all, the foundation for fortunes comes from bearish times, with the riches reaped during bullish periods. Having bought a bunch of tokens, the next thing to do is hunt for a good wallet to store them in. When it comes to wallet types, there are primarily two types: cold and hot wallets. The former refers to hardware wallets that come in the form of a USB stick and a desktop application as the UI for it. The latter are divided into mobile wallets, browser-extension/web wallets, and desktop wallets. In this article, we are going to focus on the last kind.  Page Contents  [] The easiest way to think about desktop wallets is that they are wallet apps designed for computers. Technically- speaking, there are no mobile versions, so users cant easily access it across multiple devices. However, some wallet developers want to offer users the option of a mobile app if they so desire. My suggestion is that if you choose the desktop version, ignore the mobile app. As inconvenient as it may seem, its also more secure because theres only one way to access it. I would swap convenience for security any day when safeguarding my precious crypto assets. There are a few things to consider when looking to get a desktop wallet. Some of these considerations are based on your purpose for getting the wallet in the first place. Some wallets only support one type of crypto, mainly Bitcoin or Ethereum. Other wallets support every token traded on major exchanges. Unfortunately, this usually doesnt include newer tokens that only get listed in DEXs. When I first came across, I didnt realise until later that its an example of afull nodewallet. Whenever I boot it up to check on my ADA holdings, its downloading a copy of the Cardano blockchain onto my laptop. Unfortunately, the bigger the blockchain got, the longer it took to access the wallet on my poor laptop. Unless you are looking to run a full blockchain node yourself, I would say that a full node wallet isnt something suited for everyone. For example, most of us use our wallets to transfer funds or do some staking. In this case, theSimple Payment Verificationtype would be sufficient to suit our needs. Most wallets in the market are of this type. It verifies that a transaction is in the blockchain without downloading the entire blockchain. Its standard to assume that any desktop wallet worth its salt should at least have seed phrase protection. You are also given a recovery phrase to access your wallet if your computer is stolen or destroyed. Going one step up would be 2FA. Short for Two-Factor Authentication, the two-factor part refers to what you know and what you have. A password is an example of the former, and an Authenticator app like Google Authenticator or Authy is the latter. The app generates a 6-digit code entered in the wallets interface as proof of having something. Some wallets even come with themultisigoption. Short for multi-signature, its not enough for one person to sign a transaction independently. Instead, the number of people established initially all need to sign the transaction to show complete agreeance for the transaction to go through. That way, even if one person is compromised, the funds still cant be moved. As long as something is online, getting hacked is always possible, even if that possibility might be quite low. If the desktop wallet is connected with a hardware wallet, this greatly decreases the risk of stolen funds since it still boils down to what you have. In this case, funds transfer needs to be approved with the USB device that is the cold wallet. Hackers from afar would be unable to get their hands on this device.  Check that the funds you want to protect are in the account or wallet address connected to the hardware wallet. For example, with browser-extension wallets, the connected account is not necessarily the default account, so you will need to transfer funds to the correct account. No matter how secure the desktop wallet is, if the UI is poorly-designed, its not going to have many people using it, which defeats the purpose of its existence in the first place. It needs to have a certain level of intuition that most people can grasp without resorting to watching how-to-use videos on YouTube. When things go wrong, as they sometimes will, reaching out to someone who can look into your problem is a great relief. One of the most common reasons for wanting to talk to customer support is when funds dont show up as expected, especially if you can see that it was a successful transfer on the blockchain explorer. Email support would be the bare minimum. Chat support would be better but dont hold your hopes up for phone support. Unless there is a financial entity behind the wallet, who will pay for the staff to chat with you? Aside from providing a safe space for you to store your funds and allowing you to send and receive funds, some wallets also have other functions like crypto-trading or staking. These wallets integrate with a trading platform so that you can trade while still retaining custody of your funds. Theres also no need to trade on a decentralised exchange which entails going to a different website. However, this is not the cheapest option. I guess thats the price for both convenience and security. Nothing is perfect and expecting anything like that is just an invitation to disappointment. Here are some of the things to watch out for when using desktop wallets: Now that we have covered most of the bases lets get cracking looking at whats available to choose from in the marketplace! Before Satoshi, there was. Or so they would like to claim. In reality, the first  was launched in August 2014., the same year Mt Gox went kaput. Having been around the block, it is one of two top hardware wallets in the industry. Sorry if I have to cheat a bit here by including it in this article, but it has a desktop interface and doesnt come with a mobile version, so lets just let that slide, shall we? The wallet comes with what looks like a fancy car key as the hardware component. This is paired with the desktop app for managing the assets supported by the wallet. The interface is relatively clean and straightforward and supports pretty much any token under the sun. One of the leading industry standards for wallets. Image via Trezor Aside from retail owners, Trezor is also used by many significant enterprises and endorsed by Coindesk, Forbes etc. If these companies trust Trezor to do their job, there is no reason for you and me not to. Trezors no. 1 competitor is, and Im sure the feeling is mutual between them. The company started in 2014, the same year as Trezor and is based in Paris, France. The desktop app, known as Ledger Live, is the interface for their hardware wallet, of which there are three models. Through the app, you can stake, swap assets and even manage your NFTs directly. Unlike Trezor, which needs to rely on a third-party intermediary like Metamask to manage NFTs, you can send, receive and see your NFTs in the Ledger Live app. However, only Ethereum and Polygon-based NFTs are supported currently. Another function in the wallet is that you can buy bitcoin directly in  through their partnership with Coinify and Wyre via credit/debit card. One of the things that always makes me antsy about buying bitcoin is the time it takes to transfer it from wherever to the Ledger wallet (Disclaimer: I own a Ledger wallet). So being able to go from buying to storing in a cold wallet in one shot is as safe as it goes for making a crypto purchase. However, the rates arent always the best as its pretty much a spot purchase, i.e. buying based on market rate and the fees are also something to consider. Robust security and an easy-to-understand interface. Image via Ledger In my early days of getting my feet wet in crypto, that was when I heard about. At the time, I thought all it had was the mobile version. Only much later did I find out that they have a desktop version. Unlike other wallets that simply list Linux as one of the supporting operating systems, they listed specific Linux distro packages such as Fedora, Ubuntu and Debian. That tells you how serious they are when it comes to the business of desktop wallets. Its also a prime example of a wallet providing more than just the basics. Aside from supporting a variety of tokens, they allow users to buy crypto with a regular credit card with a 1% cashback. After purchasing the tokens, you can also earn some juicy staking rewards directly in the wallet. Please note that they only support 13 tokens for staking currently, so check first before you buy if this is what youre interested in. The most unique feature about Atomic that is not found with the other wallets (yet?) is their native token AWC. With a current price of$0.535, it is a BEP-20 token. Earn up to 20% staking the token with Atomic and get 1% cashback for exchanging tokens in the app. Theres even a hint of a referral program coming soon! Theres not as much talk about their security features as some of the wallets do, so while Im sure its as safe as they can make it to be, Id likely only store enough crypto in it as a way of diversification, but that I wont lose sleep over if anything were to happen. A multi-asset wallet that does more than just store tokens. Image via Medium.com/Thorchain One of the most well-known bitcoin wallets, Electrum is a multi-sig wallet with cold storage capability for storing your precious bitcoin. Although it also has a mobile version, were just going to focus on the desktop version for our current purposes. They partner with TrustedCoin in providing the 2FA service. How the multi-sig wallet works is that it has three keys. The user owns two of the three keys, and the third key is in a remote server. A small fee is charged for every transaction using that server. Featuring a no-frills UI and integration with Trezor and Ledger for additional security, this is a basic wallet for all things Bitcoin, including the. When setting up the wallet, you can choose from a series of options. As basic as it comes but gets the job done. Image via Electrum app One of the most popular wallets around, I know quite a number of people who swear by . Its also a top wallet recommended by many in the know, including Investopedia, for beginner users, according to their website. The wallet comes with both a desktop and mobile option but feel free to ignore the latter if you choose the former. Its also integrated with Trezor to provide an extra layer of security. What struck me about the wallet is that it makes full use of the space allocated for a desktop app. Aside from showing the portfolio with key numbers, you can also see the chart for a chosen asset and other useful information. While there is quite a bit of info packed into it, the layout is still pleasing to the eye and, more importantly, not overwhelming. 200+ assets in a colorful yet elegant interface. Image via Exodus Not content with being just a multi-asset wallet supporting more than 200 assets, Exodus also features an exchange within the wallet, allowing for easy swaps between assets without any additional sign-in or navigating to other pages. This is an integration with, giving you access to the exchanges features without signing up for an account with them. Another partnership that benefits users is withby allowing them to earn yield from the DAI in their wallet. Sports-betting is also possible with Exodus, and not just for regular sports such as baseball, basketball etc., but also for E-sports like League of Legends. In the meantime, other apps are in development and will no doubt be unveiled when they are ready. A key selling point of the wallet to newbies is its 24/7 human support. They also have an extensive Knowledge Base section that includes a section on blockchain education so users can learn a bit more about the assets they have. If I were a newbie, I would consider using Exodus.  Every now and then, Id come across certain things that seemed to pop up repeatedly. Thewallet is one of those. Its a wallet under most peoples radar, yet the reviews are mostly positive, as seen on this page from. The wallet is aimed at the mainstream crowd with the following features: The website also features quite a sizeable section on crypto education where one can learn about crypto basics, written in pedestrian language, i.e. language that most people understand. This messaging is consistent with their approach of being the wallet for the everyday Joe. Customers can talk to someone via Live Chat to answer any questions or concerns they may have. At the same time, email support is available during the after-hours period. A wallet for the everyday Joe  Image via Guarda One of the things you might notice as you browse the homepage foris its claim to being the oldest multi-asset wallet. It was established in 2014, which in most cases, being less than a decade old, doesnt seem much, but in crypto-land, where six months is equivalent to 1.2 years in normal speed, that does seem shy of being next to the dinosaurs. It also makes it impressive and maybe suitable for the casual crypto user because it supports a wide range of fiat currencies in more than 20 languages. With versions available for Windows, Mac and Linux, it is one of the wallets on this list that has a decent social presence, with communication channels on Facebook, Twitter, Telegram, Reddit and Instagram, pretty much covering all the major age and gender groups, with TikTok being the only channel they dont have a presence. Additionally, they offer 24/7 live support, undoubtedly music to a beginners ears, as they can expect some handholding when exploring the wallets features. They also feature YouTube tutorials if you prefer to learn by watching than reading. All the reasons to use Coinomi listed in colorful headings. Image via Coinomi Some interesting features of the wallet include: Nice UI to attract some eyeballs. Image via Coinomi Thewallet is another single-asset desktop wallet for storing Bitcoin with cold storage and multi-sig support. They pioneered managing Bitcoin offline with a computer that never touches the internet. Instead, transactions are made with a watching-only wallet, but the private keys themselves are stored in the offline computer. This greatly reduces the attack surface for hackers. The source code for the wallet is open-source and available for audit and views on GitHub. So in the unlikely event the entity behind it goes under, it is still possible to access your funds with a bit of know-how. The website also has a tutorial section on using the wallet for various functions. As it was designed for developers to use, the UI is very basic. But enough to do what needs to be done. When it comes to security, though, its pretty top-of-the-line. Given the opportunity, I wouldnt mind storing my bitcoin in this wallet. For a free wallet, its as good as it gets. A free wallet with top-notch security for your bitcoin. Image via Armory Weve covered some of the more well-known ones available in the market. It is by no means an extensive list but to give you an idea of what is considered standard functionality and what is a unique selling point. Most importantly, its about finding a wallet that fits your needs, and its ok if no single wallet fulfils all of them. In fact, it might not be a bad idea to diversify a bit by having two or even three wallets for your crypto. That way, if anything bad were to happen to one of them, youd still have your assets safe in other wallets. Just dont spread yourself too thin that you cant manage what you own.",coinbureau,coinbureau,Positive,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1

In a recent  with Coindesk, Hoskinson pointed out why we need to be more careful stating: If you move too quickly, as weve seen with Luna, and weve seen withlast year, you could actually get it to work until it doesnt, and then when it doesnt its a catastrophic failure and everybody loses their money In contrast, Hoskinson said that he and his company IOG (formerly IOHK) are moving deliberately in building the Cardano network playing the long arc game, measured not in weeks or months, but in years to decades.

Hoskinsons Cardano project is one of the most closely watched in the industry, amassing vast amounts of attention from retail and institutional investors alike partly thanks to Grayscales Smart Contract Platform Fund.

88,2022-05-30,"Bitcoin and Stocks: Not the Decoupling We Were Hoping For",https://www.coinbureau.com/news/bitcoin-and-stocks-not-the-decoupling-we-were-hoping-for/," Bitcoin has been showing a strong relationship to the stock market in recent months, with a notably strong correlation in performance with the Nasdaq. But last weeks market data suggests that this correlation is weakening and could be coming to an end. For a long time, crypto enthusiasts have been keen to see a decoupling in the relationship between Bitcoin and traditional financial markets so Bitcoin can live up to its potential narrative of being an , , and a useful asset to hold as part of a . Bitcoins performance in recent months has gone hand in hand with the greater stock market, reducing its effectiveness in the mentioned narratives. When stocks are up, BTC price has gone up, and when stocks drop, Bitcoin typically follows suit. A Look at Bitcoin vs the Nasdaq composite index. Image via This past week saw green action across the stock markets, with the Nasdaq up 3.1%, while Bitcoin has fallen 3%, not exactly the sort of decoupling we have been hoping for. The United States Commerce Department released  on May 27th, showing that personal savings rates fell to 4.4% in April, reaching the lowest levels since 2008. This has sparked fear among investors and crypto traders that worsening global macroeconomic conditions could lead to further aversion for capital allocation to risk-on assets, which is how Bitcoin is viewed by many institutional investors. One of Bitcoins strongest narratives that we are yet to see play out is as a viable risk-off asset class, a store of value similar to the likes of Gold that could lead to further inflows of institutional money into the asset. A further decoupling could help drive this narrative to fruition. As institutional investors have been cautiously dipping their toes into the Bitcoin pool, the asset has been largely treated as a risk-on asset, along with tech and speculative growth stocks, which has led to Bitcoin seeing similar buying and selling patterns. Bitcoin holders often argue against the asset being treated as a similar speculative gamble and feel that institutions are failing to see Bitcoins true potential. While one week of data is not enough to make any definite conclusions, this new inverse correlation is interesting to see. It appears that for the past week, for better or for worse, Wall Street agreed with the sentiment that Bitcoin should not be placed in the same basket as other assets.

In  for a testimony to the Committee on Financial Services in Washington, Brainard alluded to the recent  (UST) debacle that wiped out over $50 billion in wealth, and used it as an example of why comprehensive regulation should exist for stablecoins. There has been explosive growth in an emergent digital financial system built around new digital assets and facilitated by crypto-asset platforms and stablecoins as settlement assets, she said. Two widely used stablecoins have come under considerable pressure. One widely used algorithmic stablecoin declined to a small fraction of its purported value, and the stablecoin that is the most traded crypto asset by volume temporarily dipped below its purported one-to-one valuation with the dollar.

The Fed official said that currently, there may not be an immediate need for a , but that in the future, there could be conditions that may give rise to such a need. We recognize there are risks of not acting, just as there are risks of acting. Brainard suggested that if stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies  what she refers to as private monies  rise to prominence and become widespread, there may be a fragmentation of the US payment system into so-called walled gardens. If and when private money does rise to prominence, Brainard hinted that it could coexist with CBDCs, and the two asset classes could ultimately complement each other. In a way, cryptocurrencies in some nations are already complimenting CBDCs as governments enter a race to digitize their money system. In Norway, Norges Bank has already  a CBDC pilot that runs on an Ethereum layer-2 protocol called Nahmii, stating: We are planning further development projects based on the same technology. The technology will be particularly relevant for collaboration with alliance partners (including banks) and as a basis for a sandbox. The plan is for the prototype infrastructure to be made available as open source code  hopefully during the summer of 2022.

The report, titled Decrypting financial stability risks in crypto-asset markets, while mostly a critique and warning of the industry, does reveal some bullish metrics. For example, the ECB says that based on results from its recent Consumer Expectation Survey (CES) from six larger eurozone countries, as much as 10% of households may own crypto-assets Most crypto-asset owners reported holding less than 5,000 in crypto-assets, with a slight predominance of smaller holdings (below 1,000) in this group, they said. At the other end of the spectrum, around 6% of crypto-asset owners confirmed that they held more than 30,000 in crypto-assets.

It also found that respondents were either at the top level of financial literacy or at the bottom, similar to the U-shape found in their income disparities. On the other hand, the ECB says: Crypto-assets lack intrinsic economic value or reference assets, while their frequent use as an instrument of speculation, their high volatility and energy consumption, and their use in financing illicit activities make crypto-assets highly risky instruments. This also raises concerns over money laundering, market integrity and consumer protection, and may have implications for financial stability. The government body reiterated that crypto assets are not suitable for most retail investors, either as an investment or store of value, warning that they could lose a large amount of the money they have invested. The ECB also listed all the usual alleged risks associated with crypto, including misleading information, the absence of rights and protections such as complaints procedures or recourse mechanisms, and product complexity with leverage sometimes embedded.

While Tethers   investment portfolio does include an investment in the company, representing a minimal part of our shareholders equity, there is no correlation between this investment and our own reserves or stability,  Tether wrote in .

Wall Street giant JPMorgan is gearing up to bring trillions of dollars of tokenized assets into the world of blockchain-based decentralized finance (DeFi) as it looks to tap the yield-generating potential of non-crypto assets  with the scale of institutional assets.    Over time, we think tokenizing U.S. Treasurys or money market fund shares, for example, means these could all potentially be used as collateral in DeFi pools,  Tyrone Lobban, head of Onyx Digital Assets at JPMorgan,  on stage at Coindesk's Consensus 2022 conference in Austin, Texas ().  The overall goal is to bring these trillions of dollars of assets into DeFi, so that we can use these new mechanisms for trading, borrowing [and] lending, but with the scale of institutional assets.   JPMorgan, after  quietly  exploring digital identity in the context of blockchain and digital assets over the last two years, is trying to balance traditional finance's know-your-customer (KYC) rules with DeFi and crypto's permissionless lending pools.   Look out for these cryptocurrency and crypto-adjacent events this week.  Tomorrow, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chairman, Gary Gensler, will deliver remarks on the SEC's agenda at  organized by the Wall Street Journal.

On Wednesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve will announce its latest interest rate decision with economists widely predicting another 50 basis point hike. However, higher-than-expected inflation numbers on Friday did put the prospect of a 75 basis point hike on the table, though that remains unlikely.  European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde is speaking at a London School of Economics event on Wednesday. Last month, Lagarde, an outspoken crypto critic, .  On Thursday, the U.K.'s Bank of England will make its interest rate decision. While it's expected to follow the Fed in raising rates, the latest economic growth numbers out this morning, revealing the U.K.'s economy contracted by 0.3% in April after it shrank by 0.1% in March, have increased the possibility it will put its planned hikes on hold. - ","Billy Bambrough",forbes,Positive,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The Federal Reserve is backed into a corner now,  crypto investor and influencer Anthony Pompliano wrote in his newsletter after the latest inflation data was released. On Friday, data showed prices in the U.S. rose faster than expected in May, rising to 8.6% after easing in April, fueled by rising energy and food costs and pushing inflation to its highest rate since 1981.  Inflation hasnt subsided even though the Fed has been increasing interest rates and conducting quantitative tightening. They dont have many more options other than to simply put their foot on the gas. The Fed could try to accelerate the interest rate increases, both in speed and severity, along with accelerate quantitative tightening. Im not sure that they will do it, but there arent many other avenues to pursue.  Next week, the Fed is expected to raise its interest rate to 1.25%-1.50%, after a similar move last month.

Bitcoin's ongoing correlation with macro-forces-roiled stock markets has snuffed optimism and sparked frustration at a time when crypto seems to be missing the perfect opportunity to demonstrate its forgotten role as a hedge against inflation,  Rich Blake, financial consultant at crypto platform Uphold, wrote in emailed comments.  As monetary tightening accelerates around the world, stocks, in the short run, are still vulnerable to lower lows, noting telltale signs of a cyclical bear market.
